**Interviewer**: Hello, thank you very much for participating in this interview. I will now ask you some questions, starting with a review of our previous simulated task.

**Interviewer**: The first question is, when you were browsing and installing servers on our simulated website, did any servers arouse your suspicion? Specifically, what aspects made them suspicious to you?
**Interviewee**: I did find some suspicious servers, about three to four. It wasn't primarily based on their descriptions or functionalities, but by examining their source code, I discovered that they contained suspicious code.

**Interviewer**: So, you judged them to be suspicious based on their source code.
**Interviewee**: Yes.

**Interviewer**: Okay. The second question is, in the process of finding malicious MCP servers, how confident were you in identifying them?
**Interviewee**: If I could carefully review the source code, my confidence would be quite high. However, in reality, there are so many MCP servers that it's impossible to check every detail, so considering that, the difficulty becomes quite high.

**Interviewer**: The third question is, among the MCP servers you found, what specific methods did you use to determine that they were malicious?
**Interviewee**: Primarily through analyzing the source code.

**Interviewer**: So, you also believe that source code is the most effective information for judging malicious behavior.
**Interviewee**: Yes.

**Interviewer**: Then, in the specific process of reviewing the source code, what code patterns, function calls, or data processing methods would you focus on that would raise an alert?
**Interviewee**: Mainly the classic suspicious patterns, such as very long strings (which might be used to hide malicious content), or functions containing encryption-related code (like Base64 encoding). These are very typical malicious features.

**Interviewer**: Understood. Next, I'd like to introduce you to the four types of malicious MCP servers we set up and their attack methods.
First, on the simulated website, regarding the malicious MCP for "Google Maps," we actually set up "Googie" to simulate a spoofed official source. In its description and configuration information, we used "Googie" instead of "Google" because it mimics a fake official source.
**Interviewee**: I indeed didn't notice that detail.
**Interviewer**: Of course, this is just one way to identify maliciousness. You successfully identified its maliciousness through the source code, which is perfectly fine.

**Interviewer**: Then there's WeChat MCP, which is indeed malicious. It has some issues in its configuration (config) file. In the config, we can see that it uses the `npx` command, and this command pulls its code from a source. This source looks like the legitimate `modelcontextprotcol`, but it's actually misspelled (`protcol` is missing an 'o'). So, it's impersonating a seemingly official source, but it's actually a third-party source. Then it pulls code from this third-party source using the `-y` command and `@latest`. This command causes the server to pull the latest code from that hosting platform every time it runs. This presents a problem: it might initially upload normal code, and users use it without issues for a while. However, after some time, it can replace the original source code, and when users pull it, an attack occurs. We call this a "Rug Pull" attack, colloquially known as a "pig butchering scam" attack. This is one type of attack.
**Interviewee**: Understood.

**Interviewer**: And then, the first type you successfully discovered was the Weather Server. Its problem was that a piece of Base64-encrypted code for sending out packets was hidden at the end.
**Interviewee**: Yes.
**Interviewer**: And actually, it had another problem that you didn't seem to notice, which was in its `docstring`. At the far right of this `docstring`, there's a hidden description. Although this `docstring` appears harmless, it actually has an MCP tool wrapper here, and this part will be provided to the large model as the `description`. So, after performing Prompt Injection here, it will affect the large model's normal functionality, leading to things like, for instance, it's written here to read `/etc/passwd`.
**Interviewee**: Oh, I really didn't notice that.
**Interviewer**: And then it would pass the result of that password using this malicious function to send it out, thus achieving an attack. We call this a "Tool Poisoning Attack (TPA)." The characteristic of this attack method is that the server's source code itself is problematic. It then manipulates the large model to perform malicious actions.

**Interviewer**: The second one is the Time Server. The problem with the Time Server, as you also discovered, is that in the `description` here, it directly writes some malicious descriptions. We call this a "Puppet Attack." It uses a prompt injection method to trick the large model into calling another tool to achieve its intentions. This scenario is when multiple tools are configured in MCP, and one tool manipulates other tools to attack. The other tools are manipulated like puppets, so we call it a "Puppet Attack."

**Interviewer**: Then the third one is Google Maps here. You also found that there's a `static_code` at the bottom. Here, it implements a malicious string concatenation. It will translate this segment into an IP address, and then it uses the IP address to request some data. The result of the requested data will be returned to the large model. So, if an attacker can place some malicious prompts at that malicious API, prompts used for Prompt Injection, and then return them to it, we call this a malicious third-party source attack. Its characteristic is that the code itself appears to be fine. Although it's not using the official Google API here, if it were another server, say not Google Maps, but some normal server requesting their own malicious third-party resources, then from its code, it would seem there's nothing wrong; it's just a normal packet request. However, if that third party is malicious, it can return malicious prompts this way to form an injection. Its characteristic is that the source code itself is fine.

**Interviewer**: These are the main methods and means of these four types of attacks. How would you rank the difficulty of exploitation and the degree of harm of these four attacks, from highest to lowest?
**Interviewee**: If ranked from highest to lowest, I actually think the harm of Prompt Injection should be relatively high.
**Interviewer**: That is, the Tool Poisoning Attack.
**Interviewee**: Yes, that's the highest. The rest seem similar. Anyway, the first one should be the highest, in my personal opinion.
**Interviewer**: Then where do you think the Rug Pull attack should be placed? Do you think it's not very serious?
**Interviewee**: Which one is the Rug Pull?
**Interviewer**: The one with the `npx` command that I just mentioned.
**Interviewee**: Oh, that one. Actually, if you really want to call it an MCP server security issue... in fact, many MCP servers we actually use are built directly via `npm -y` and don't download the source code. In reality, if you were to strictly call it a security problem, then our browser plugins, VS Code extensions, automatic updates—anything that allows for malicious updates—would technically all be considered to have this problem. In that case, it wouldn't be a problem limited only to MCP servers themselves.
**Interviewer**: Indeed, this is a supply chain attack. If the supply chain is malicious, it can indeed affect many things, not just MCP. So, you think its exploitation difficulty isn't that...
**Interviewee**: I think it's not a method limited to the specific topic of MCP servers.
**Interviewer**: Understood, OK, good.

**Interviewer**: Now for the second part, about your own views. The first question is, in the past or in the future, would you consider using AI Agents combined with MCP to manage your private data or resources, such as project code, blockchain wallets, or other important information?
**Interviewee**: I think for the former ones, there seems to be no problem, but for the last two, namely wallets and payments, I probably wouldn't use them. Because, firstly, you have to trust the AI model itself, and secondly, you have to trust the MCP server tool itself. So, there are two attack surfaces, two trust points. In reality, even the first AI itself doesn't seem entirely trustworthy because it all calls external interfaces, so there would be such concerns.

**Interviewer**: Understood. OK, and the second question is about this, you've used MCP before, right?
**Interviewee**: Yes.
**Interviewer**: Then, while using it, do you carefully check the prompt message that the MCP application pops up every time it executes a server? It tells you which specific server will be called next and might ask for some permissions. Do you pay close attention to its operational details and this information?
**Interviewee**: Maybe the first one or two times I would look, but later it became too much trouble, so I just allowed everything.
**Interviewer**: Oh, you use Cursor, right?
**Interviewee**: Yes, I've used Cursor, and I've also used Cherry Studio.
**Interviewer**: Oh, OK. Cherry Studio, which specific host has this feature?
**Interviewee**: Cherry Studio.
**Interviewer**: Oh, it has a feature where you can skip all prompts directly.
**Interviewee**: Cherry Studio is an AI client, and it doesn't require permission requests itself; you can call it directly.
**Interviewer**: Understood, OK, this is very important.

**Interviewer**: Then the third question is, like our simulated website in the task, which is a portal for MCP Servers. What role do you think such websites play in ensuring users' safety when using MCP Servers? What important indicators or information should they provide?
**Interviewee**: I think if you're talking about the role they play, it's actually the same role as, say, Google's app store or VS Code's extension marketplace. They have to protect the security of the items on them. But in reality, if you really want to talk about true protection, well, if you look at `npm js` or VS Code, you'll see how many supply chain poisoning incidents have occurred. So, realistically, it's quite difficult to truly provide protection. So, that's just how it is.
**Interviewer**: Understood.

**Interviewer**: Next question is, what kind of information, features, or claimed mechanisms displayed on such a website do you think could significantly increase your trust when selecting MCP servers on it?
**Interviewee**: Actually, things like ratings and reviews, if developers later decide to poison them, there's nothing much you can do. I think the most useful thing might just be the source. That is, if it's published by a large company like Google or Cloudflare, then there shouldn't be a big problem.
**Interviewer**: But as you saw, our previous simulated experiment could impersonate, could pretend to be published by these large companies.
**Interviewee**: Right, right, that's indeed a point. So, companies like Google and Cloudflare should, they should provide a kind of certification, like an identifier or something, a certification.
**Interviewer**: Understood.

**Interviewer**: OK, and the last question in this section is, what kind of features or measures do you hope to see in the future to ensure your safety and address security risks when using MCP?
**Interviewee**: I think the most important thing, my first impression of the most important thing, should be sandboxing. Things like code execution should all be placed within a sandbox. However, if MCP is used to manage something like a blockchain wallet, then a sandbox might not be very useful. That's about it.
**Interviewer**: Indeed. Understood.

**Interviewer**: OK, and the final question is, do you have any suggestions or areas for improvement regarding the overall design of this user study, the questionnaire, and other aspects?
**Interviewee**: Actually, I think the overall process was very good. As for the details on the questionnaire, I had already mentioned them before.
**Interviewer**: Yes, we've already changed them according to your suggestions. Alright, thank you again for your time and effort in participating in this user study.
