**Interviewer:** Hello, it's a pleasure that you could take the time to participate in this interview. During the process of browsing the simulated websites and installing servers, did any server raise your suspicion? If so, what aspects of these servers made them seem suspicious to you?
**Interviewee:** I think it was a service like the Weather MCP Server from before; there might be some issues in its code.
**Interviewer:** Specifically?
**Interviewee:** For example, its prompt content seemed to have some extra information.
**Interviewer:** So, you found them suspicious when you reviewed the source code snippets?
**Interviewee:** Yes.
**Interviewer:** Then, in your subsequent browsing of these simulated MCP servers, how confident or certain were you that you could identify potentially malicious MCP servers?
**Interviewee:** I wouldn't say I have great confidence. If it's an injection within the prompt, then it can be identified by checking the prompt or description content. But if it calls some third-party API that I don't recognize, it would be difficult to identify such malicious code.
**Interviewer:** In the task, you identified the Weather server as malicious. Your method of judgment was to check the description information in its source code, correct?
**Interviewee:** Yes, that's correct.
**Interviewer:** So, among these three types of information provided by the platform vendor—the introduction and description information, the provided source code, and the displayed configuration method—which was most useful for you in identifying malicious behavior?
**Interviewee:** Code, code is definitely the most useful.
**Interviewer:** Afterwards, when you were reviewing the source code, besides the description information, were there any specific code patterns, function calls, or data processing methods that particularly raised your red flags?
**Interviewee:** Not yet, because different codes have quite different contents.
**Interviewer:** Next, I'd like to introduce you to the four types of attacks and methods we've identified for malicious MCP servers.
For example, Weather Server, as you said, hides malicious functions and description information, performing description injection to trick the large model into executing malicious operations. This means the server itself is malicious, providing a polluted prompt to the large model and performing malicious operations. We call this a "tool poisoning attack."
Next is Time Server. Its malicious behavior occurs during the tool definition phase. When defining the tool, the description part of the tool contains a malicious prompt that tricks the large model into thinking it's the correct way to use the tool. When calling other tools (like a transfer tool), it won't transfer to the user's intended address but rather to an address claiming to be for privacy relay, thereby stealing user funds. This is called a "puppet attack," because the large model is tricked during the description phase, driving a benign tool to execute malicious operations.
Another one is the Google Map server. Its maliciousness lies in a hidden URL within its source code. It requests this URL and passes the returned information directly to the large model without modification. An attacker can deploy malicious prompts on this URL, turning the local server into a relay, an intermediary for the attack. The server itself shows no malicious prompts or descriptions; instead, the attack injection is achieved via an external third-party website. We call this a "malicious third-party resource attack."
The last type is WeChat MCP. Its problem lies in its configuration method. It uses the `npx -y @latest` method, and its configuration source is not a legitimate official source. In its Model Context Protocol description, the word "Protocol" is missing an "o," disguising it as a third-party source imitating an official one. Attackers can place malicious code here. Furthermore, using the combination of `-y` and `@latest` means that every time the user starts the service, the latest code will be pulled from a third-party hosting platform. This allows for a possibility: attackers first upload normal, non-malicious code, and once the user trusts it, they replace it with malicious code, implementing a "rug pull attack" (pig butchering scam), meaning it starts out benign but later turns malicious.
I've just explained these four attack methods: tool poisoning attack, puppet attack, malicious third-party resource attack, and finally, rug pull. From the perspective of exploitation difficulty or severity of harm, how would you rank them?
**Interviewee:** I think the last one (rug pull) should be the most difficult to identify.
**Interviewer:** Is the exploitation difficulty and severity of harm also relatively high?
**Interviewee:** Yes, because it's hard for developers to spot these issues. These aren't problems that users or developers typically pay attention to. For instance, description injection, since it's mostly text content, users and developers might look at it, so the attack difficulty isn't particularly high.
**Interviewer:** Next, I'd like to ask for your views on MCP ecosystem security. Have you in the past, or do you plan to in the future, attempt to use AI agents with MCP to manage your private data or resources, such as project source code, personal notes, blockchain wallets, etc.?
**Interviewee:** Not yet, for now.
**Interviewer:** Okay. Is the reason you don't plan to because of security concerns?
**Interviewee:** Yes.
**Interviewer:** Have you used MCP in the past?
**Interviewee:** Yes, I have.
**Interviewer:** When you used it, didn't a pop-up window always appear each time you executed an MCP server, informing you what service was about to be executed and requesting permissions, such as local file read permissions? Do you carefully read its description?
**Interviewee:** Generally, I don't read them.
**Interviewer:** Then, do you pay close attention to its operational details? For example, which server it calls next, what content it returns, or what happens afterwards—these kinds of running details?
**Interviewee:** I rarely look at those either, because I generally trust these services quite a bit.
**Interviewer:** Regarding MCP portal websites, aggregation websites, or app marketplaces, like the ones simulated in our task, what role do you think such websites should play in ensuring user security?
**Interviewee:** Obviously, they need to filter these services first. Like the attack methods mentioned earlier, they should identify all of them before allowing them to be uploaded to the website.
**Interviewer:** So, you also believe they bear some responsibility for user security.
**Interviewee:** That's correct.
**Interviewer:** As a user, when browsing and searching for desired MCP servers, what kind of information, features, or verification mechanisms would significantly increase your trust in them?
**Interviewee:** Community user reviews might be the most crucial. The more people use it, the higher the trustworthiness naturally becomes. This also includes security evaluations among MCP service providers.
**Interviewer:** What kind of features or measures do you hope to see in the future to improve the security risks of MCP during its application?
**Interviewee:** Auditing.
**Interviewer:** Source code auditing?
**Interviewee:** Yes.
**Interviewer:** Finally, do you have any suggestions for the overall design of this user study, or areas you believe could be improved?
**Interviewee:** I think it's quite good.
**Interviewer:** Thank you for taking the time and effort to participate in this user study and interview. This interview concludes here.
