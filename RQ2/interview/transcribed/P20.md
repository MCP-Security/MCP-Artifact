**Interviewer:** Okay, thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this interview. For the first part, let's review the task. When you were browsing and installing servers on the simulated website, did any server raise your suspicion? If so, what specific aspects made them seem suspicious to you?

**Interviewee:** When simply browsing, if there's no explicit prompt indicating a problem with the service, I generally wouldn't specifically scrutinize it, nor would I notice or care if there was anything suspicious. I usually approach it with a trusting attitude.

**Interviewer:** Okay, I see. Then, in the subsequent process of looking for these malicious MCP servers, how confident or certain were you in your ability to identify potentially malicious MCP servers?

**Interviewee:** If I'm just simply browsing on the website, I don't have much confidence. Because the information about MCPs on the website, such as internal code information and its actual functions, is usually just a simple introduction, and it only presents the functions it wants us to know. As a user, when browsing a website, I wouldn't go and scrutinize its code first.

**Interviewer:** So, would you be confident in identifying them after seeing the malicious server's source code, or would you still not be confident?

**Interviewee:** That depends on the situation. If malicious instructions were directly included in the description to manipulate large models, I think I'd still be able to spot them. But these malicious codes can be hidden very deeply, and if you just glance at them, you might not notice them.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Task 3 was for you to view the source code and analyze its malicious aspects. In this process, would you pay attention to any specific code patterns, function calls, or data processing methods? For instance, features that would make you particularly vigilant?

**Interviewee:** If there's hardcoded or suspicious strings in the code, I'd be more vigilant.

**Interviewer:** Hardcoding, okay. Earlier, we introduced you to four types of attacks and methods: Rug Pull, tool poisoning (or supply chain poisoning), malicious third-party resource exploitation, and puppet attacks. How would you rank the difficulty of exploitation and the severity of harm for these four types of attacks?

**Interviewee:** From a threat perspective, I believe malicious third-party resource exploitation and tool poisoning pose a higher threat.

**Interviewer:** Yes, overall threat, meaning those that are easy to exploit and high in harm would rank higher. So you believe malicious third-party resource exploitation and tool poisoning have the highest threat level?

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** Okay. The next question is about your views on MCP ecosystem security. In the past or future, would you consider using AI Agents combined with MCPs to manage your private data or resources, such as project source code, blockchain wallets, etc.?

**Interviewee:** I believe I would. I'm already inclined to use AI Agents to manage personal notes. Because Agent content generation and output are quite convenient, and using them to link personal notes, I find it a very comfortable mode.

**Interviewer:** So even after learning about so many security concerns, would you still choose to use it?

**Interviewee:** I might be more vigilant. Because the harm caused by these attacks is quite significant, I believe.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Then, when you previously used MCPs, would you carefully examine the details of the prompt messages and permission requests each time an MCP application was executed?

**Interviewee:** I think that depends on the specific client. For example, with something like Cherry Studio, the prompt might just be a single line, very simple, so I might not look at it. But with certain clients (such as those that are more detailed in their presentation), even if you've set them to auto-approve, they'll still painstakingly display information. For instance, what information the large model obtains from the MCP and what information it passes to the MCPâ€”all of it will be shown in a dialogue box. At that point, I'd have to pay attention.

**Interviewer:** So if it's displayed, you would carefully read it, and not ignore it due to information overload (alert fatigue)?

**Interviewee:** Hmm, I think I'd at least take a look. This also relates to the complexity of the information structure it conveys. For example, a weather MCP might just simply convey a location. But if the JSON data the client shows me, in addition to the location, also contains a string of inexplicable content, I might become vigilant and wonder why these extra things are being passed to the MCP, and then I would go and check.

**Interviewer:** Okay. One more question, for portal or aggregation websites like the one we simulated in our task, what role do you think they should play in ensuring user safety? That is, what role should these MCP aggregation websites play in ensuring user safety?

**Interviewee:** Since they are aggregation platforms, they are somewhat like promoters. They promote various convenient MCP services to users, encouraging them to download MCPs through their channels. They also gain traffic, advertising, and revenue from this. Therefore, I believe they need to be responsible for every user who downloads an MCP through their channels, and ensure that the products they promote are safe and problem-free. They should at least assume the responsibility for security auditing.

**Interviewer:** So they should bear security responsibility, correct?

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Then, what kind of information, features, or verification mechanisms would make you particularly trust an MCP server once you see them?

**Interviewee:** I hope it could at least display a security badge. For example, explicitly stating that the service is verified, or that many users have given positive feedback (it's OK).

**Interviewer:** So, user reviews and security badges, correct?

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** Okay. What kind of features and measures do you hope to see in the future to improve MCP security risks?

**Interviewee:** I think sandbox and gateway mechanisms might be a better direction. Because there are so many MCPs now, source code auditing for all of them isn't very realistic, and attack methods are diverse and varied, and source code auditing can hardly achieve 100% security. But sandboxes and gateways can directly intercept and block attacks based on their principles, and I think the effect would be better.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Last question, do you have any suggestions for the overall design of this user study, or areas you think could be improved?

**Interviewee:** I think it's quite good; currently, I can't think of any areas for improvement.

**Interviewer:** Okay, thank you for your cooperation. Thank you again for dedicating your time and effort to participate in this user interview.
