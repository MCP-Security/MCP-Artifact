**Interviewer:** Hello, thank you for taking the time to participate in this interview. The first question is: While browsing and installing the simulated web servers, what aspects of the servers did you mainly suspect and find questionable?

**Interviewee:** Mainly some issues regarding the configuration on the server's introduction page. For example, some servers claimed their compilation method was NPM, but what they actually provided was Python source code.

**Interviewer:** How confident or certain are you that you can identify potentially malicious MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers?

**Interviewee:** If I don't check the source code, I probably can't identify them accurately.



**Interviewer:** Okay. The next question is: How did you determine that these MCP servers were malicious?

**Interviewee:** I would search for "requests" calls in the source code, and then check if it sent out any sensitive information by calling "requests".



**Interviewer:** So, you feel that this specific code pattern of "requests" calls is particularly alarming to you, is that right?

**Interviewee:** Yes. Of course, there might be other ways to leak sensitive information.



**Interviewer:** Understood. Next, I'll introduce you to the four types of malicious MCP server attacks and methods involved in our research.



**Interviewer:** The first one is "Weather," which is a weather query server. Its problem lies in a hidden packet-sending function at its core, specifically a "request" function, which transmits information to a third party.



**Interviewer:** The second issue lies in its "docstring description" in a certain place. This description appears harmless, like a comment. But in reality, there's a strange comment on the far right whose content manipulates the large model to read the sensitive file `/etc/passwd`, and then sends it out through the function at the bottom, achieving covert data exfiltration. This description looks harmless, but because it has the `mcv.tool` wrapper above it, the entire "docstring" will be fed to the large model as the description of this tool. In this way, a "prompt" injection can be achieved within the "description" to make the large model perform malicious actions. We call this type of malicious server, caused by issues within the tool itself, "tool poisoning."



**Interviewer:** The next one is "Time," an MCP server for time queries. Its problem lies in the "description" field. A strange point was also added to the "description" it defined: it deceives the large model into calling or transferring funds to a simulated malicious address first when calling another transfer tool (which is a cryptocurrency transfer tool). At the same time, it tells the large model that these are some characteristics of the transfer tool, thereby misleading the large model. This act of deceiving the large model within the tool's own description information to misuse another tool, especially in a multi-MCP server environment, is an attack we call "puppet attack." In this scenario, the other tool becomes a puppet manipulated by the attacker, allowing the large model to misuse another benign, normal tool to achieve the attacker's desired outcome.



**Interviewer:** The third one is "Google Map," which is a Google server. There are actually two suspicious points here. The first point is the server's description information. We can see that the author of this server is named "Googie" instead of "Google"; they changed "l" to "i." This means it's actually impersonating an official source; it's not a legitimate server. Now, specifically in the code, its malicious aspect is that it uses three static "position encodings" in one place to concatenate and form a malicious URL. It used two segments of these "position encodings," claiming them to be position encodings, but in reality, these encodings would be decoded into a malicious URL. Then, a concatenation is performed here, forming a URL, which it then requests. What does this process do? This function is a tool, and the attacker will deploy a malicious prompt for "prompt injection" at that malicious URL. Then, after this function obtains that prompt, it returns it to the large model unchanged. This means that this entire MCP server acts as an attacker's springboard. The attacker only needs to place such malicious descriptions on that remote webpage to achieve manipulation of the large model or various prompt injection-related attacks. The characteristic of this attack is that the function and the entire file itself are normal. Other than seeing that it accesses third-party resources, I cannot see any other malicious points or descriptions; it is all very normal. This behavior of using the MCP server itself as a springboard to attack third-party resources, we call it the act of using third-party resources to attack large models, specifically, "malicious third-party resource attack." This is the third attack method.



**Interviewer:** And the fourth type is actually a bit similar to what you just mentioned, which is "WeChat MCP." First, its source code has no issues at all. Its source code is fine, but its attack method lies in its server configuration part. It used the `npx` command, `npx -y @latest`. First, its source is incorrect; it's called "Model Context Protocol," which seems fine, but the word "protocol" is missing an "o"; it's typed as "tcol." This means it's not a genuine official source; it's impersonating an official source to make users think it's official. And at the same time, what does `npx -y @latest` achieve? It achieves that every time you, the user, run this server, it will pull the latest code from the NPM hosting platform. Each execution of this command will pull the latest code, which also allows attackers to initially upload good code, which users can then download and use normally without issues. But after some time, the attacker uploads a piece of malicious code, turning this server into a malicious MCP server, and then users download it again and get attacked. This is very much like a "pig butchering scam" in the supply chain, which is a "Rug Pull." We refer to it as a "Rug Pull" attack.



**Interviewer:** These are the situations for the four types of attacks. After hearing the descriptions of these four attacks, how would you rank their difficulty of exploitation and their severity?

**Interviewee:** I feel that the one leveraging third parties, specifically deploying a prompt on a third-party website, should be the hardest to detect.



**Interviewer:** Hardest to detect, and then the harm is relatively high.

**Interviewee:** Hmm. And then, the one in the configuration (Rug Pull) should be second.



**Interviewer:** So "Rug Pull" is second. And the latter two are about the same?

**Interviewee:** Hmm, and I feel the one that utilizes "requests" ranks last.



**Interviewer:** Meaning it's the easiest to find. Because the tool itself is malicious, and its description and behavior are all malicious, it is indeed relatively easy to detect. I understand what you mean.



**Interviewer:** Now for the next section, which is about views on MCP ecosystem security. Have you considered, or would you consider in the future, using AI Agents combined with MCP to manage your private data or resources? For example, project source code, personal notes, and so on.

**Interviewee:** Would I consider it? Hmm, it seems there are still security issues currently. Later, perhaps.



**Interviewer:** Possibly consider. OK. The next question is, have you used MCP before?

**Interviewee:** Hmm, no.



**Interviewer:** OK, then we'll skip this question. Uh, the next question is, in our task, didn't we simulate a portal website for MCP servers, a site with many MCP lists available for users to download? What role do you think such websites should play in ensuring user safety? That is, what key security indicators or information should they provide for users to see?

**Interviewee:** Hmm, at the very least, regarding the server configuration part we just discussed, I think it should explain what each parameter means. For example, with the last `npx` we saw, there was a `-y` parameter and an `@latest` (latest version) parameter underneath it. It didn't explain what `-y` meant.



**Interviewer:** `-y` actually means "yes" by default, so users don't have to manually type "y." It's like automatically typing "y" for you every time. That indeed presents security issues, because then users wouldn't even know what's happening, and everything would be installed instantly. It definitely would be problematic. So, you believe that these "host platforms" or such portal websites should thoroughly explain to users how configuration files are set up, what specific functions they have, and so on?

**Interviewee:** Hmm, yes.



**Interviewer:** Understood. Uh, then the next question is, when you are choosing an MCP server, what kind of information, features, or verification mechanisms would make you particularly trust that MCP server?

**Interviewee:** Hmm, I might first check its user reviews. And if there are no obvious, uh, "reporting"-like contexts in the user reviews, then I might trust it more.



**Interviewer:** OK. Uh, alright. And the last question in this section is, what kind of features or measures do you expect to improve security risks in future MCP application processes?

**Interviewee:** I think source code auditing is very good. And perhaps developing some tool-like things to detect vulnerabilities in the code.



**Interviewer:** OK, I understand what you mean. The last question is, do you have any suggestions or areas for improvement regarding the overall design of this user study?

**Interviewee:** Hmm, I feel the scenario design might need to be reconsidered, or perhaps there's no need for a scenario at all, just allow free usage.



**Interviewer:** Understood, so you feel that the initial scenario, which aimed to have users plan a trip or similar, wasn't necessary?

**Interviewee:** Hmm, roughly. Because there are things like GitHub there, which are, uh, unrelated to travel, or should be unrelated.


**Interviewer:** Hmm, right, it depends on what the user can achieve. If a user develops their own travel planning AI Agent and wants to deploy it to GitHub. Of course, that's rather extreme, but your suggestion is certainly valid. We will improve next time. Thank you again for taking the time and effort to participate in this user study interview. This interview concludes now.
