Here is the English translation of your interview transcript, maintaining the original format:

**Interviewer:** Hello, thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this interview. My first question is, when you were browsing and installing servers on our simulated website during the initial phase of Task 1, did any servers raise your suspicion?

**Interviewee:** No, not at the moment.

**Interviewer:** Okay. For the second question, while browsing the MCP servers on the simulated website, Tasks 2 and 3 required you to identify specific malicious MCP servers. How confident or certain do you feel about being able to identify these potentially malicious MCP servers?

**Interviewee:** Without auxiliary tools, I'm actually not very confident in my ability to identify malicious attacks.

**Interviewer:** Okay. For the third question, you identified two malicious MCP servers during the task. How did you determine that these MCP servers were malicious?

**Interviewee:** At that stage, I used a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the code and found some malicious code within it.

**Interviewer:** During this analysis process, what kind of information did you primarily provide to the large model?

**Interviewee:** I provided its source code along with some descriptive information to the large model, asking it to help me determine if there was malicious code in its program.

**Interviewer:** So, in which part of the information did the large model ultimately discover these malicious MCP servers?

**Interviewee:** The large model eventually found a URL link with malicious behavior within an MCP server called 'Weather'.

**Interviewer:** Was that found in the source code?

**Interviewee:** Yes, but the puppet attack was not successfully detected by the LLM, because it misinterpreted the misleading prompt intended to misdirect it as a normal tool description.

**Interviewer:** While reviewing the source code yourself, were there any specific code patterns or function calls that raised your suspicion, leading you to believe they were malicious?

**Interviewee:** When I personally reviewed the source code, I didn't find any specific patterns. However, during the large model's analysis, it was vigilant about some common malicious attacks.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Let me introduce you to the four types of malicious attack methods for MCP servers that we've identified. The Weather MCP you found is an example of this: it has a malicious function at the bottom, which sends information to a third-party URL. Additionally, in the description on the far right, there's a prompt designed to manipulate the large model into performing malicious actions. We call this method a Tool Poisoning Attack. In essence, the server itself is malicious; it's 'poisoned,' and it uses this method to make the large model read sensitive user information or tamper with returned results, etc. This is known as a Tool Poisoning Attack.
The next attack is called a Puppet Attack. This method involves misleading the large model via the description, making the large model believe it needs to use another tool to perform a different action. In other words, it uses the description of one tool to influence the large model to manipulate another tool. We call this a Puppet Attack, effectively making another tool a puppet of the attacker at that moment.
Then there's the third method: it constructs a malicious URL address. This server then accesses that URL, takes the result returned from it, and provides that result to the large model. This allows the attacker to deploy text for prompt injection at that malicious URL. This text is then used to interfere with the large model's behavior. A key characteristic is that the function or code itself doesn't contain any malicious prompts or descriptions. The code itself is relatively normal; the prompt injection attack is achieved through a third-party malicious URL.
And the fourth attack method is exemplified by the WeChat MCP, where its configuration uses `npx -y @latest`. This ensures that every time a user executes the MCP server, it pulls the latest code. By injecting malicious code into the latest version, a rug pull attack can be achieved. We call this a Rug Pull attack.
After hearing the descriptions of these four attacks, how would you rank their exploit difficulty or the severity of the potential harm?

**Interviewee:** I feel that users are most susceptible to issues in the deployment environment, specifically with the WeChat MCP and rug pulls. Yes, that's quite serious because most people directly invoke these things and might not have a deep understanding of them. As for your Puppet Attack, I think if the disguise within the description isn't good, users actually have a certain possibility of detecting it. So, I think its overall harm might be the smallest. The second most harmful, perhaps, would be like the malicious third-party resource that crafts a harmful URL using unknown encoding. Honestly, if you only look at the code, it's quite difficult to spot; you'd only discover it after running it once, but by the time you run it, you've already been attacked.

**Interviewer:** Understood, thank you. Now, let's move on to the second part: your views on ecosystem security. The first question is, in the past or future, would you consider using an AI Agent combined with MCP to manage your private data or resources, such as project source code, personal notes, blockchain wallets, or online payment platforms, etc.?

**Interviewee:** I personally am quite inclined to use such AI tools to manage some of my personal resources.

**Interviewer:** So, you would consider using it in the future?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I would utilize it in the future.

**Interviewer:** Understood. The next question is, have you used MCP before?

**Interviewee:** Once or twice.

**Interviewer:** When you used MCP, during the process, didn't the application pop up some prompts? For example, asking you or telling you which MCP servers were executed this time, and then if it requested certain permissions, you'd have to click 'allow' for it to continue running, right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, that's right.

**Interviewer:** Do you pay close attention to its operational details, such as which functions it calls or what actions it performs?

**Interviewee:** I probably only pay attention when it reports an error or when it fails to call something successfully.

**Interviewer:** Okay. The third question: for an MCP portal website like the one we simulated in the task, what kind of role do you think it should play in ensuring user security?

**Interviewee:** I believe it should at least play the role of informing users about security risks. It needs to provide users with useful security indicators or potential risks that might exist.

**Interviewer:** What kind of security indicators, features, or verification mechanisms do you think would make you trust an MCP server?

**Interviewee:** It might need to have a user declaration before invocation, or perhaps information about potential sources of attack. At that point, I might pay closer attention to the security of these MCPs.

**Interviewer:** Okay. What kind of features or measures would you hope to see in the future to improve the potential security risks associated with using MCPs?

**Interviewee:** Ideally, it would certainly be best to protect it well from the source code level through code auditing.

**Interviewer:** And then the platform would issue an audit report, certifying that the source code has been audited?

**Interviewee:** Mm-hmm, yes, that's right.

**Interviewer:** Okay. The last question is, do you have any suggestions or areas for improvement regarding this user study or the overall design?

**Interviewee:** No, it was excellent.

**Interviewer:** Alright, alright. Thank you again for your time and effort in participating in this study. Thank you.
