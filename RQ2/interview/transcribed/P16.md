**Interviewer:** Thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this interview. First, let's review the tasks you completed earlier. During your simulated website browsing and server installation process (Task 1), did any server initially raise your suspicion?
**Interviewee:** No.

---

**Interviewer:** Okay. Next question, when browsing the MCP servers on these simulated websites in Tasks 2 and 3, how confident or certain were you in identifying potentially malicious MCP servers?
**Interviewee:** My confidence wasn't very high, and my certainty in identifying them wasn't great.

---

**Interviewer:** Alright. Since you didn't find any malicious MCP servers in the tasks, we'll skip one question. The fourth question is, during the process of reviewing the source code, were there any specific patterns, function calls, or data processing methods that particularly raised your alert?
**Interviewee:** Function calls, I'd say.

---

**Interviewer:** Can you elaborate on what kind of function calls would trigger your alert?
**Interviewee:** For example, function calls that might read local files, or access third-party links.

---

**Interviewer:** Yes, exactly. Okay. I previously explained four types of attack methods for malicious MCP servers to you. How would you rank the exploit difficulty and severity of these four attacks?
**Interviewee:** I think Rug Pull Attack is the most dangerous and easiest to exploit. Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack ranks second. Tool Poisoning ranks third. Puppet Attack is the most difficult to exploit, but its harm is very high. I think the risk of the latter two (Tool Poisoning and Puppet Attack) is about the same.

---

**Interviewer:** I understand. Next, I'd like to ask for your thoughts on MCP ecosystem security. Would you consider using AI Agents combined with MCP to manage your private data and resources in the past or future?
**Interviewee:** Yes, I would.

---

**Interviewer:** So, after hearing our introduction to malicious MCP servers, would you still consider managing them in this way?
**Interviewee:** Yes, I would.

---

**Interviewer:** Okay. So, in your past usage of MCP, would you carefully check the prompt messages and permission requests each time an MCP application executes? Would you pay attention to the operational details?
**Interviewee:** No, I wouldn't.

---

**Interviewer:** Alright. So, for the websites simulated in the tasks that provide MCP servers, what role do you think they should play in ensuring user security? Do you believe they should bear significant responsibility for user safety?
**Interviewee:** Absolutely, they must bear responsibility.

---

**Interviewer:** Okay. What key security indicators or information do you think they should provide to earn your trust? For example, audit reports, security badges, official certifications, and so on?
**Interviewee:** Yes, I think these are all necessary to provide. Of course, other supporting evidence is also very important, such as third-party attestations.

---

**Interviewer:** Okay. As a user, what kind of information, features, or verification mechanisms do you think could significantly enhance your trust in MCP servers?
**Interviewee:** I think user reviews are very important.

---

**Interviewer:** Okay. Last question, what kind of features or measures do you expect to improve MCP security risks?
**Interviewee:** I think source code auditing is a very valuable and reliable measure.

---

**Interviewer:** So, you hope that all MCP servers you see on websites have undergone source code auditing, is that right?
**Interviewee:** Yes.

---

**Interviewer:** Okay. Finally, do you have any suggestions for the overall design of this user study?
**Interviewee:** I think this design is very good, there's nothing that needs improvement.

---

**Interviewer:** Okay, thank you for your affirmation. Thank you again for investing your time and effort in participating in this user study interview. This interview concludes here.
