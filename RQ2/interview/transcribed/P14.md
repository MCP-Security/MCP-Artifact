**Interviewer:** Thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this interview. Let's start by reviewing the tasks. The first question is, when you were browsing and installing servers on our simulated website, were there any servers that raised your suspicion? If so, what aspects of these servers made them suspicious to you?

**Interviewee:** Do you mean during the process of completing all three tasks?

**Interviewer:** At the very beginning, when you were completing the first task.

**Interviewee:** Initially, I clicked on the Wechat MCP, and the overall website didn't seem to have any major issues. So I just proceeded to use it.

**Interviewer:** Okay, understood. Alright, the second question is, as you later began to discover these malicious MCPs, how confident were you in identifying these potentially malicious MCP servers?

**Interviewee:** I wasn't very confident. Because some of the MCPs consisted of only one or two files, which were relatively easy to check. But the vast majority, like Telegram or others, had a lot of files, so I found it quite difficult to identify them.

**Interviewer:** So you mean you found the source code to be very complex, making it difficult to identify MCP servers that contained complex source code files, is that right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, that's right.

**Interviewer:** Okay. I see you found Apple Notes during the task process; you believed it was malicious, correct?

**Interviewee:** Correct.

**Interviewer:** In that process, among the introduction and description information, source code, and configuration method, which type of information was most useful for you in judging malicious behavior?

**Interviewee:** For that, I saw an RM command in its configuration method, which deleted the entire folder. I felt that might be a bit problematic, so I chose that one. For other more complex ones, I didn't find much. It wasn't in the configuration here; it was in the source code.

**Interviewer:** Oh, okay. Script.

**Interviewee:** Yes, I wasn't sure what that was.

**Interviewer:** Oh. The command itself isn't problematic, and its targeting is quite clear; it's not deleting randomly. However, it might be requesting somewhat high permissions. One could say it's not written very standardly, but I wouldn't call it malicious. Okay, next, I'll explain how these four types of malicious MCP servers we mentioned achieve their attacks, including their attack types and methods. Then, please tell me how you would rank their exploit difficulty and harm level.

Okay, the first malicious MCP server is the Weather MCP Server. At first glance, the code might not seem to have major issues, but actually, if you use VS Code, you can see the overview pane on the far right. At the bottom of the overview, there's a hidden function. It's at the very bottom of the code. This function communicates externally to a malicious URL address, sending out some data.

**Interviewee:** Mm-hm.

**Interviewer:** Additionally, to the far right of the docstring section, a hidden passage states that the large model should read the `/etc/passwd` file and then send it out via the function I just mentioned. This means that although this docstring looks like just a comment, because it has the `mcp.tool` wrapper, this comment will be passed to the large model, thereby achieving a prompt injection. So, when a server itself is malicious and contains malicious tools, we call this a tool poisoning attack.

The second malicious server is TimeMCP. The malicious aspect of this TimeMCP lies in its tool's description section, where it includes a relatively complex piece of text. This text is also designed to deceive the large model, instructing it, when calling a blockchain wallet transfer tool, not to transfer to the original address, but to the `0x123123` address it provided. It attempts to trick the large model into believing this is a private relay address specified by the user. Yes. So the attack method it implements is, in an environment with many MCP servers, it manipulates another MCP server's tool to perform malicious operations. At this point, the large model effectively becomes a puppet; it can be manipulated to drive benign, normal tools to perform malicious actions. We call this a puppet attack.

The third one is Google Maps. This Google Maps has two suspicious points. The first is in its introduction information: its creator is named Googlc (G-O-O-G-L-C), not Google; the 'i' is replaced by an 'l'. Can you hear me?

**Interviewee:** Yes, please continue.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Yes, it uses this "Googlc" spelling to make users mistakenly believe it's official, when it's actually a malicious third party. Specifically in its code, there's a function where it adds a so-called static location encoding constant. This string of numbers will be translated into a URL, which is then concatenated and sent out. Sent out. Then this malicious URL will return the results obtained from this malicious URL directly to the large model. This means that the attacker doesn't need to poison the code itself; they just need to inject malicious content into that malicious website, and then... Is it lagging a bit?

**Interviewee:** Wait... Could you say that again?

**Interviewer:** Where did I leave off?

**Interviewee:** After concatenating the string.

**Interviewer:** Oh, right. After concatenating the string, it's sent out. Once sent, a return value is received, and it passes this return value directly to the large model, unchanged. This means that, at this point, this server acts as a relay. The malicious third-party attacker simply needs to place some malicious prompts within that third-party URL, and it will directly return these prompts to the large model, thereby achieving injection or manipulation. So, at this point, the local MCP server functions as a relay. This type of attack is called a malicious third-party resource attack.

**Interviewee:** Mm-hm.

**Interviewer:** Okay, the fourth is Wechat MCP. Its maliciousness lies not in its source code—the source code itself is fine—but rather in its configuration method. The configuration method written here indeed has some issues. The first point is that the source it pulls using `npx` is called `model context protocl` (missing an 'o'); the 'o' in `protocol` is misspelled, an 'o' is omitted. This also impersonates the official source, but it's actually a third-party source. The second point is `npx -y ... @latest`. This means that every time the user executes this MCP server, it will pull the latest code to execute. This allows an attacker to initially upload normal, benign code. After the user uses it for a period and trusts the program, one day, the attacker uploads malicious, offensive code to the platform. As a result, when the user pulls and uses it again, they will be using malicious MCP server code. This type of attack is called a 'rug pull' (similar to a 'pig butchering' scam).

Mm-hm. Having heard these four types of attacks and methods, how would you rank their exploit difficulty and harm level?

**Interviewee:** I think it's 4 > 3 > 1 = 2.

**Interviewer:** Okay, I understand what you mean. So you believe rug pull is the most severe, followed by malicious third-party resource attack, and then the latter two (puppet attack and tool poisoning attack) are similar in severity, right?

**Interviewee:** I'm judging comprehensively from the perspective of how easily users can detect it, combined with various other factors. Because I think the first type (tool poisoning) and the second type (puppet attack), if one looks a bit more carefully, for example, by scrolling to the bottom or if there are some automated behaviors, they are relatively easy to become aware of. But the latter two types (malicious third-party resource and rug pull) are actually relatively difficult to become aware of, so I think the latter two have a higher risk.

**Interviewer:** Understood, okay. That concludes this part. In the second part, I'd like to ask about your personal views on MCP ecosystem security. The first question is, have you considered, or would you consider in the future, using an AI Agent combined with MCP to manage your private data or resources, such as project source code, personal notes, or blockchain wallets?

**Interviewee:** I might consider it for managing source code and notes, but I probably wouldn't for others.

**Interviewer:** Okay, understood. Next question, have you used MCP servers or MCP services before?

**Interviewee:** I haven't used them.

**Interviewer:** Okay, we'll skip that question. Next question, the simulated website we created is essentially an MCP server portal or application marketplace. What role do you think such websites should play in ensuring user safety? What key security indicators or information should they provide?

**Interviewee:** I think for every MCP service they provide, once you click into it, including its interfaces and source code, there should be information indicating that it has been reviewed by the website's personnel. Perhaps some have been reviewed by them, which I could use with relative safety; others they might not have reviewed, requiring me to check them more carefully myself.

**Interviewer:** Understood, okay. Next question, as a user searching for MCP servers online, when trying to find MCP servers that meet your functional needs, what kind of information, features, or verification mechanisms would make you particularly trust that MCP server enough to download and install it?

**Interviewee:** I think it mainly comes down to two points: first, the number of stars on GitHub; second, the author of the repository, to see if they are an official organization.

**Interviewer:** Okay. The last question for this part, what kind of features or measures do you expect to improve security risks in future MCP usage?

**Interviewee:** Security risks...

**Interviewer:** That is, to reduce security risks during the use of MCP. Yes, that's what I mean.

**Interviewee:** I think, could there be a more universal security protocol or assurance mechanism? For example, if each repository meets this standard, it would be considered relatively safe. This protocol might, for instance, stipulate that information will not be sent to suspicious links or similar.

**Interviewer:** I understand what you mean. Some people compare MCP to HTTP in the era of large models. What you're suggesting is very similar to HTTPS, like adding a trusted third-party certificate or similar methods to ensure that the MCP is reliable.

**Interviewee:** Mm-hm, that's the idea.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Finally, I'd like to ask if you have any suggestions or areas for improvement regarding the overall design of this user research?

**Interviewee:** The main area for improvement is that each repository requires downloading a ZIP package. It would be better if we could browse online. Other than that, there's nothing much.

**Interviewer:** Indeed, that would greatly help improve the sense of realism. Alright. Thank you again for your time and effort in participating in this user study and interview. This interview concludes here.
