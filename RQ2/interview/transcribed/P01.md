**Interviewer:** Thank you very much for participating in this interview. First, reflecting on your task of browsing and installing servers on the simulation website, did any servers initially arouse your suspicion?
**Interviewee:** Yes, there were some.
**Interviewer:** Which servers specifically?
**Interviewee:** For example, servers related to WeChat and WhatsApp. If an MCP server needs to access these two communication applications, I would think it might have privacy issues.
**Interviewer:** So you're concerned it might steal user privacy?
**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** When browsing MCP servers on the simulation website, how confident are you in identifying potentially malicious MCP servers?
**Interviewee:** It depends on the length of the code. For short code, I would review it myself; for long code, I might use AI models to help with analysis.

**Interviewer:** During your code review process, were there specific code patterns, function calls, or handling methods that particularly raised your alarm?
**Interviewee:** Most were related to APIs, such as concerns about API key leakage and similar issues.

**Interviewer:** Alright, now let me introduce you to several types of malicious MCP server attacks and methods, totaling four categories.
The first malicious MCP server is about weather calls. It hides a malicious prompt in the documentation string at the bottom, asking the AI model to view and output the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file. This prompt looks like a comment, but due to the existence of the `mcp.tool` wrapper, it gets fed to the AI model as a tool description, causing injection. We call this Tool Poisoning Attack (TPA).
The second type is a time-checking tool whose description contains some strange text, asking the AI model to call a blockchain wallet transfer tool named `wallet_action`, and replace the recipient address with `0x123123` each time it's called. The AI model thinks this is the correct way to use the tool. This attack applied in the MCP server environment is called a Puppet Attack, characterized by driving the AI model to call a normally functioning benign tool to achieve malicious behavior desired by the attacker.
The third is Google Maps. Its maliciousness has two aspects: First, in the server description information, the creator is `GoogIe` (using uppercase I instead of L), trying to impersonate the official version. Second, its malicious method is defining two strings of `place_static_code` in a function that look like location codes but are actually malicious URLs. These URLs later decode into IP addresses, and the program requests these IP addresses, feeding the returned content to the AI model. The code itself looks safe, but attackers can host malicious content on third-party servers, achieving stealthy injection.
The fourth type is WeChat MCP. Its characteristic is that the source code itself has no problems. The malicious aspect lies in the server's configuration method: the request information has `model_context_protocol` misspelled (missing an 'o'), making users think it's from an official source. Then it uses methods like `npx -y @latest`, making users pull the latest version from the source every time they execute. Attackers can first upload normal code, then update it to malicious code after users have been using it for a while. We call this a Rug Pull attack, also known as a pig-butchering attack.

**Interviewer:** After hearing about these four attack methods, how do you rank them in terms of exploitation difficulty and harm level?
**Interviewee:** In terms of how difficult they are to discover, I think:
1. Google Maps type (injection through malicious URLs, using third-party resources) is the hardest to discover.
2. Next is the WeChat type (Rug Pull attack).
3. Then the Weather type (Tool Poisoning Attack), which also depends on the user.
4. Finally, the time tool type (Puppet Attack).

**Interviewer:** Next are some questions about your personal views on MCP ecosystem security. The first question: In the past or future, would you consider using AI Agent plus MCP to manage your private data or resources? For example, project source code, blockchain wallets, etc.
**Interviewee:** It depends on the maturity of the technology. If the technology is mature and widely used, I might consider it.
**Interviewer:** I understand, you would consider it, but you'd focus on whether it's specifically secure and mature.
**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** In your past use of MCP, would you carefully examine MCP applications? Have you used MCP servers before?
**Interviewee:** No.
**Interviewer:** Okay, we'll skip this question then. Next question: Regarding MCP server markets like the one simulated in the task, which we call portal websites or app stores, what role do you think such websites should play in protecting users and ensuring user security?
**Interviewee:** As platforms providing this service, I think they should at least review the MCP servers that are listed.
**Interviewer:** I understand, so you're saying they have security responsibility for the MCP applications they list.
**Interviewee:** Yes.
**Interviewer:** Actually, we conducted a follow-up study where we found some well-known platforms, such as Smithery, which is currently the most used MCP server marketplace by users, hosting about five to six thousand, or even nearly ten thousand MCP servers. We submitted an MCP server that was declared malicious (but functionally harmless), and it was still successfully listed and remains online to this day. This shows that these platforms may not be conducting effective reviews.
**Interviewee:** (laughs)
**Interviewer:** So these platforms, although they claim to have reviews, may not actually be doing them properly.

**Interviewer:** What kind of information, features, or verification mechanisms do you think could significantly improve your trust in MCP servers?
**Interviewee:** First, I think open source is important. Additionally, source authentication is also a method.
**Interviewer:** (pointing out that the previously simulated malicious servers were also "open source," but the interviewee didn't fully identify their malicious code)
**Interviewee:** (laughs)

**Interviewer:** So, what kind of features or measures do you expect in the future to improve MCP security risks?
**Interviewee:** Code auditing, conducted by professional personnel. It would be better if audit reports could be issued.
**Interviewer:** Yes, being able to issue audit reports would be better.
**Interviewee:** Right.

**Interviewer:** Last question: Do you have any suggestions or think there are areas for improvement regarding this user research interview?
**Interviewee:** No, it was already perfect.
**Interviewer:** Okay, thank you for your recognition. Thank you again for investing your time and effort in participating in this user research interview. This interview is now concluded.
