**Interviewer:** OK, let's start. Thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this interview. The first task is to recap your experience browsing the simulated website and installing servers. I saw that you found some malicious MCP servers. So, what aspects made you feel these servers were malicious?

**Interviewee:** I think it's more about looking at the content on its homepage. Because, if a malicious service requires code comparison to determine if it's malicious, users usually don't have the time or search depth for that. For example, the one for Google, its developer is clearly not Google, and it looks very much like a fake. So I immediately concluded it was malicious, without looking at the specific reasons in its code. Including the WeChat one, its description had both Chinese and English, which seemed very unprofessional. And Tencent officially doesn't have such a WeChat MCP service. So I immediately concluded it was malicious.

**Interviewer:** You could tell these servers were malicious just from the description, without needing to look at the code. OK. Then, in this process, how confident or certain were you in identifying potentially malicious MCP servers?

**Interviewee:** To be honest, not very confident. Firstly, you told me there were 4 out of 13. If you hadn't told me those 4, it would have been difficult for me to judge. The only one I could consistently identify was the Google one; it was too outrageous. As for the others, I remember there was another one, and also the one written in Go, called Weather.

**Interviewer:** Weather.

**Interviewee:** Oh right, that one was hard to judge. Including the Time one, sometimes when I looked at the code, I couldn't even see the line below. So I wasn't very confident.

**Interviewer:** OK. So you just explained your method for judging whether they were malicious, which was mainly by looking at the description and code. You also believe that among these three types of information — introduction and description, source code, and configuration methods — the introduction and description information is the most important.

**Interviewee:** Yes, and it seems there were no issues with configuration methods here. For example, it wouldn't ask me for any permissions or anything like that, which wouldn't raise my vigilance.

**Interviewer:** OK, good. Then, finally, you also looked at the source code. So, when you looked at the source code, were there any specific code patterns, function calls, or data processing methods that particularly raised your alert?

**Interviewee:** The Time one really raised my alert; that one was indeed a bit confusing for me. But I didn't find anything particularly unusual, which I found interesting. Another thing is that a lot of these codes were written in one very large file. I usually just put it into an LLM and let it help me review it. I remember one that concatenated a time-related string. I don't feel there was any specific code pattern that particularly alerted me. Because it seems there are many attack methods, including the NPM one; they are quite different. Does that count as a code-level issue?

**Interviewer:** After hearing the descriptions of these four attack types, how would you rank them in terms of exploit difficulty and severity?

**Interviewee:** Do I need to rank them according to your descriptions of the four, or should I rephrase them myself?

**Interviewer:** Not rephrasing, but ranking. Which type of server, for example, do you personally think has the lowest exploit difficulty and the highest severity?

**Interviewee:** I think the supply chain one (referring to Rug Pull) has the highest severity and the lowest exploit difficulty.

**Interviewer:** So, Rug Pull, supply chain, yes.

**Interviewee:** And then, regarding the LLM prompt injection you just mentioned, I think this might be defended against by things like Llama Guard. It still has a chance of failing; it won't succeed every time.

**Interviewer:** Defended by Llama Guard, right? OK.

**Interviewee:** Yes, like the LLM itself being fine-tuned or something. Including the transfer one, if MCP is truly implemented in the future, there should be some special protections. It wouldn't be a one-shot attack, at least not like that.

**Interviewer:** I understand what you mean. That's true. But according to an experiment we conducted later, testing our MCP prompt injection method on the four current SOTA models, including Claude 3.7, Gemini, and GPT-4.1, the result was that all of them could be successfully attacked. In other words, at least so far, there haven't been specific defenses for this type of attack; fine-tuning like Llama Guard hasn't achieved that yet.

**Interviewee:** Understood.

**Interviewer:** Next question is about the view on MCP ecosystem security. In the past or future, would you consider using AI Agent combined with MCP to manage your private data or resources? For example, project source code, personal notes, or even online payment platforms. Would you consider it?

**Interviewee:** No way.

**Interviewer:** Not considering it, right? OK.

**Interviewee:** Because, well, let me give you a very simple example. Once, when chatting with a friend, he said he would absolutely never enable WeChat Steps in his life. Why? He doesn't want to give his location to Tencent; he thinks it's very dangerous. So, if MCP services are widely used, for example, it also takes screenshots of the interface, right? Then it would be capturing data from its own company. If I don't trust it, or if it sells this data, that would cause a big problem. So, unless it's absolutely, absolutely necessary, I definitely wouldn't use it.

**Interviewer:** OK, I understand what you mean.

**Interviewee:** Or, if there's a truly trustworthy third party, like certain government services, then it could be considered. But if it's a private company, then definitely not.

**Interviewer:** So, it needs official endorsement for you to consider using it.

**Interviewee:** Yes, I think that's the minimum requirement.

**Interviewer:** OK. Next question, have you used MCP before?

**Interviewee:** No.

**Interviewer:** OK, then we'll skip this question. Then the next question is, like the website we used in the task, it's a portal website simulating an MCP list, or it could be a store, an app market. So, what roles do you think such a website, a real one, should play in ensuring user safety, and what key safety metrics or information should it provide?

**Interviewee:** This platform should act as a trusted third party, I think. For example, it should verify if the developers are actually who they claim to be, right? And if it makes a mistake, it needs to correct it. Filter out those fake ones, meaning those with incorrect sources. It has to be a trusted third party.

**Interviewer:** But for malicious servers like Gookie, which impersonate official platforms or official sources, what role do you think the platform should play?

**Interviewee:** For this, I think it should be marked. For example, with this Google one, how many downloads can it have, right? How many favorites. It's similar to online plugins, for example, how many people are using it. Then everyone can see at a glance with Google and Googie: this one is used by many people, and that one has very few downloads. It wouldn't be the case that no one out of ten people would notice this problem.

**Interviewer:** So, it should provide some status data or similar, right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, more information. Or comments, adding some comments could also work.

**Interviewer:** Comments, right? OK. Then the next question is about this: if it were you, when looking for an MCP server, what kind of information, features, or verification mechanisms would you expect to see on this website that would make you particularly trust this MCP server?

**Interviewee:** I actually just wanted to say that if its impact wasn't big, I would trust it, but now I don't think that's acceptable either. Because even your Time one had issues. So, you can't really judge based on features. I think it still has to be about the source. For example, if you can ensure it genuinely comes from WeChat official, then I think that's acceptable, and it would significantly increase trust.

**Interviewer:** Mhm, so it still needs official endorsement, I understand what you mean. Indeed, even an MCP server with the simplest functionality, as long as its behavior is inconsistent with its description, can cause significant harm. This really has little to do with functionality. Alright, OK. Last question, the last question in this part is, what kind of features and measures do you expect to see in the future to improve security risks during MCP usage?

**Interviewee:** Improving MCP usage risks. For example, the source code auditing you mentioned later, I think that's quite necessary. For example, all these errors of yours, I reviewed them with a large model; except for the supply chain one, I could review them all with a large model. So, this should be done, I think. It's not a very difficult code audit; they can all be reviewed.

**Interviewer:** So, a relatively crucial feature. For example, deploying large models for automated auditing, is that right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, all of these can be reviewed. I remember using GPT-4o, and it could review them.

**Interviewer:** You mean it, uh, I understand. However, another user gave feedback that when he reviewed with a large model, he found that the large model could only detect traditional malicious patterns, like `requests` and so on, but it couldn't detect description injection in the `description` field. That is, the large model would consider that `description` to be a normal piece of text.

**Interviewee:** It didn't consider it a description used for prompt injection. Uh, yes, indeed, because a large model is an aid; it doesn't explicitly state that this code is malicious.

**Interviewer:** So, there are some suspicious functional points, right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, it's suspicious, not malicious. But a human can roughly understand what it's doing at a glance.

**Interviewer:** OK. Alright, the last question is about this user study. Do you have any suggestions or areas for improvement?

**Interviewee:** Areas for improvement, huh. Uh, first, regarding your website, I mentioned a few minor detailed issues to you last time; see if you can improve them. It sometimes has small errors.

**Interviewer:** Okay, no problem.

**Interviewee:** Uh, and then, you can remove the buttons that can't be clicked. Oh, don't remove all of them. Your website actually looks very authentic; I initially really thought there was something called 'MCP Shop'.

**Interviewer:** Uh, there really is such a website; it's called MCP, without the hyphen, just remove the hyphen: `mcpserver.shop`. Uh, there really is such a website, and it's somewhat similar to ours.

**Interviewee:** Indeed, very well done, very impressive. And your zip file, your friends must all use Macs, right? Mine is Windows, and it didn't work.

**Interviewer:** Not all of them use Macs. I think the main reason is, I feel your antivirus software deleted them. Because after you unzipped it, wasn't there only a 'macOSX' folder left? But when they unzipped it on Windows, they didn't just have that one folder left.

**Interviewee:** Alright, that's a bit abstract. Or, why don't you make the tasks into an online document as well?

**Interviewer:** That's also possible, I've considered it. Yes, that works.

**Interviewee:** Alright, no more suggestions, it was excellent. Wait, let me introduce another friend; how about I have them come and learn from you too?

**Interviewer:** Sure, just make sure he fills out the user study.

**Interviewee:** No problem, he'll definitely fill it out. He just submitted a paper recently, so it's a perfect seamless transition for him.

**Interviewer:** OK, alright. Thank you for this interview.
