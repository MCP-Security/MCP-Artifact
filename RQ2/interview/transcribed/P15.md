**Interviewer:** Thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this interview. My first question is, when you were browsing and installing servers on our simulated website, especially at the beginning when you were not informed that there were malicious servers, did any server raise your suspicion, making you feel it might be problematic?

**Interviewee:** No, I probably focused more on the functional implementation of these servers, as well as some access thresholds and features. I really didn't pay much attention to aspects like their security or whether they were malicious.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Then, later, when Task 2 and Task 3 asked you to identify these malicious MCP servers, how confident were you in being able to identify potential malicious MCP servers?

**Interviewee:** To be honest, not very confident, because I feel it's a packaged black box. If I only relied on snippets of information, it would be very difficult for me to analyze, and I wouldn't be able to understand how it works internally.

**Interviewer:** Okay, so it was quite difficult. Then, OK, third, since you didn't find any malicious MCP servers in the tasks, I will skip this question. The next question is, since Task 3 asked you to analyze the source code, when you were looking at the source code, would you specifically pay attention to certain specific patterns, function calls, or data processing that you thought might be dangerous?

**Interviewee:** No, I didn't pay much attention to these malicious parts. I probably still focused on what the MCP input was, what the output was, and how it completed its functions.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Next, I will explain to you the four types of malicious MCP server attacks and methods summarized in our research, and then you can tell me how you would rank their harm or exploitation difficulty.

**Interviewee:** Mmm-hmm.

**Interviewer:** The first server is our Weather server. Its attack method is that the server itself is malicious, hiding a malicious function at the very bottom. It will send the user's API key, which the user provides to it, to a third-party URL, achieving the effect of API key theft. This kind of attack, where the server itself is malicious and directly attacks the user through malicious prompts or malicious functions, we call it a Tool Poisoning Attack.

**Interviewee:** Is that actually real? The one just now?

**Interviewer:** This, this, this was set up by me, but this kind of attack method can be implemented. It's just not real; it's a simulation I set up.

**Interviewee:** Understood, understood.

**Interviewer:** OK, and the next attack method is, here, it defines a tool, and then the information about this tool, its metadata, will be transmitted to the large model, allowing the large model to decide when and at what appropriate time to call it. And here it will tell it some usage methods for this tool, as well as the tool's description, what the tool is used for. And the attacker here, in its description information, embeds a line of malicious code—not code, but a line of malicious description. This description asks the large model, when calling a tool called "wallet transfer," to redirect the address from the original address to a malicious address, which I set as 0x123123. So, this forms a prompt injection attack scheme, where the large model is deceived into thinking it needs to do something, when in fact it's not. Through this method, an attack is indirectly formed, and we call this method a Puppet Attack. This means the large model becomes the attacker's puppet at this time; it can be manipulated to carry out incorrect, that is, malicious, actions even when calling benign, or normal, MCP servers.

**Interviewee:** OK, OK.

**Interviewer:** We call this a Puppet Attack. Then, this kind of Google Maps attack is hidden quite deeply. It, it performs a disguise here, defining a string of malicious, defining a string of static code, like position encoding or something. And this position encoding looks like a normal function of its map, but it's not. It will be escaped, meaning it will be translated and decoded into a malicious third-party URL later.

**Interviewee:** Mmm-hmm.

**Interviewer:** And then, later, it will request, it will send a request to this URL, and then directly transmit the result of that request to the large model verbatim. This is actually an attack method used by attackers: they will deploy malicious prompts on that third-party URL, and then use this MCP server as a springboard to transmit the payload, the attack payload, to the large model, achieving a prompt injection. Its characteristic is that the MCP server itself cannot be scanned for any malicious prompts or descriptions; it's undetectable. It implements prompt transmission during dynamic execution. So, directly scanning the server itself for malicious prompts is ineffective for this method.

**Interviewee:** Mmm.

**Interviewer:** Then the fourth attack method is our WeChat MCP. Its maliciousness is not in its source code; its source code has no issues whatsoever. It lies in its configuration information, the server config, how it is configured to be inherited into the MCP client. It uses this command: `npx -y` followed by `@latest`. The first point is that its source, its source is not the official source but a third-party source: `model-context-protocol`, where "protocol" is misspelled. This gives users the impression that it's an official source when it's actually a fake third-party source. It's a source registered by an attacker because they misspelled it, but at first glance, it's not noticeable. And in this way, it requests a server, requests source code, from the attacker's source. The second point is that it uses `-y` and `latest`. The combination of these two commands means that every time the user starts the MCP client, this command will be executed, which means it will pull the code from that third-party hosting platform again. This introduces a hidden danger: attackers might initially upload some normal, good code, and then after some time, upload malicious code. So, the user initially trusts it, but then at some point later, uses the code again and gets attacked.

**Interviewee:** Mmm.

**Interviewer:** We call this a Rug Pull Attack. Now that I've shared these: Tool Poisoning, Puppet Attack, Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack, and Rug Pull Attack, how would you rank these four types of attacks in terms of their exploitation difficulty and harm level, considering them comprehensively?

**Interviewee:** OK, which, which dimensions were they again?

**Interviewer:** Just exploitation difficulty. The lower the exploitation difficulty, the higher the threat level, of course. And harm level refers to the attack outcomes they can achieve and the impact on the user.

**Interviewee:** OK, this, exploitation difficulty, is it the difficulty for, for whom, for the attacker to exploit, right? Is it the difficulty of actually achieving the attack?

**Interviewer:** Yes, exactly.

**Interviewee:** Yes. OK, then I think the last two or three, the ones towards the end, might have lower exploitation difficulty. They might be harder to implement, but easier to exploit, because I feel they are more covert. For example, with the fourth type, I certainly wouldn't look at the config myself. And the second type, the prompt one, I think is okay; that is to say, for professionals, maybe for ordinary users, they wouldn't pay attention to it, but for professionals...

**Interviewer:** For professionals looking at the source code, they would notice it immediately, right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, the third one is quite tricky, but if one had some knowledge, they would see such a suspicious line of code, because, although its execution process, its prompt should be, as I understand it, inserted during dynamic execution, right? But isn't that inserted code a bit suspicious? I think so. So...

**Interviewer:** It mainly relies on its code being extremely long. You see, it's over 700 lines in total, so it gambles that most people won't look closely, so it just inserts it. But if you review it line by line carefully, you can spot it.

**Interviewee:** Yes, yes, yes. And for the last one, I actually feel it has the lowest exploitation difficulty. Things on the config, I think it's hard to pay attention to them, because people might probably care more about the implementation, or how this MCP is configured, because I understand, I believe most MCP configurations are similar. So the last one's exploitation difficulty, is "exploitation difficulty" here understood as "easier to attack"? So the difficulty is lower.

**Interviewer:** Yes. Yes, lower exploitation difficulty means it's easier to launch an attack.

**Interviewee:** Yes. As for the harm level, what aspect makes it difficult? Is it asking how great the harm would be if the attack were successful?

**Interviewer:** Yes, for example, the second type, the Puppet Attack, requires some prerequisites. For example, if the user's system truly has many other MCP servers deployed, then it can cause some impact. But if the user only has one MCP server, then this kind of pure prompt injection cannot cause much impact.

**Interviewee:** Oh. Yes, yes, yes, yes. But does this harm depend more on the purpose for which the attack was designed? For example, stealing money, I feel that harm is quite significant.

**Interviewer:** Stealing money, yes, the harm is significant, yes, yes, it can be implemented.

**Interviewee:** It's more related to the purpose, this ranking is a bit vague.

**Interviewer:** Yes, I understand what you mean, indeed. Indeed, like the Puppet Attack, if it can achieve the theft of a user's blockchain wallet, then the harm level would indeed be higher.

**Interviewee:** Yes, yes, yes, yes, because I think the goals can probably be interchangeable; it's just that the attack techniques are different.

**Interviewer:** Yes, that is, the exploitation difficulty of this Puppet Attack is relatively high, but if exploited successfully, the actual harm level is also the greatest.

**Interviewee:** Mmm-hmm, yes, yes, pretty much, yes, yes.

**Interviewer:** OK. After this question, the next part is to ask about your views on MCP ecosystem security. First, the first question is, have you considered in the past or would you consider in the future using AI agents combined with MCP to manage your private data or resources, such as project source code, personal notes, or blockchain wallets?

**Interviewee:** Mmm, yes, yes, I would. Project source code, personal notes, and communication tools possibly, but blockchain wallets and online payment platforms, I most likely would not. Social media might be even after communication tools.

**Interviewer:** OK. Then, what is the reason for not considering it? Is it a distrust of the AI agent itself, meaning the large model, or a distrust of the MCP application itself?

**Interviewee:** Oh, no, it's not that. I, I, I am quite embracing of the first four, so it shows that I am optimistic about technology, but it's my personal habit not to entrust money-related things to any software.

**Interviewer:** OK, understood, it's due to personal habit, OK.

**Interviewee:** Yes, personal habit.

**Interviewer:** And have you used MCP before?

**Interviewee:** I have used MCP indirectly, yes, I've used it with ChatGPT.

**Interviewer:** OK. Then, because every time MCP is run, these clients generally pop up warnings or permission requests, telling you what the MCP server is about to do, and what permissions it needs from you. Do you carefully read the details of these?

**Interviewee:** Mmm, I don't read them, I don't read them.

**Interviewer:** Okay. So, like the website we simulated in the task, which we can call an aggregation website, or a portal platform, or an app marketplace. What role do you think such websites should play in ensuring user security?

**Interviewee:** Oh, OK. On one hand, initially, it should be like vulnerability detection. When a new MCP is launched, it must have the ability to detect them. Yes, they need to perform the first step of screening. Second, during actual use, hmm, second, I think during use, it should also perform real-time checks and provide warnings to users. Third, perhaps during actual use, hmm, I hope it can, if it's software—if it's just a website, that's fine—but if it's a piece of software or a tool, I hope it can capture abnormal behavior during execution. And be able to actively interrupt it. Yes.

**Interviewee:** I hope it can do that.

**Interviewer:** OK, and the fourth question is, as a user, when you are looking for an MCP server that meets your requirements, what kind of information, or features, or verification mechanisms would make you particularly trust this MCP server?

**Interviewee:** Mmm, source authentication. If it's labeled as an official source, I'll most likely use it.

**Interviewer:** OK. And finally, for this part, the last question is, what kind of features or measures do you expect to see in the future to improve MCP's security risks?

**Interviewee:** Mmm. Yes, a sandbox is indeed a very good approach. And I think besides that, there might be something else, which is, hmm, it can, it can be allowed to make a few mistakes, but I hope it can be traceable. I don't know if a sandbox has this feature, for example, if we...

**Interviewer:** Traceable, by traceable, do you mean a transparent trace for every step executed by the server and the large model, similar to what you find in microservice systems?

**Interviewee:** Yes, a trace. If it really stole my money, I hope I can get it back.

**Interviewer:** Get it back, oh.

**Interviewee:** Meaning, identify who it is.

**Interviewer:** Oh, I understand what you mean, OK.

**Interviewee:** OK.

**Interviewer:** OK, and finally, do you have any suggestions or areas for improvement regarding the overall design of this user study?

**Interviewee:** Mmm, not at the moment.

**Interviewer:** OK, thank you again for your time and effort in participating in this user study.
