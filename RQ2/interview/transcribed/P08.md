**Interviewer:** OK, let's begin. First, thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this interview. Let's start by reviewing the previous tasks: When you were browsing the simulated website and installing our servers, were there any servers that aroused your suspicion, making you think they might be malicious?

**Interviewee:** My main suspicion was with map-related services because they must use my location information. But on second thought, as a location and specific map service, it's impossible for it not to use my location information, so it's actually quite difficult to judge.

**Interviewer:** So you think these functionalities might steal your private information?

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** OK. Then for the second question, do you have the confidence or certainty to identify these potentially malicious MCP servers?

**Interviewee:** Actually, not much confidence. The reason I use them is because my coding ability is relatively weak and I don't have much foundation, which is why I use them. Therefore, I myself am not really able to identify them.

**Interviewer:** OK. The next question is, when you discovered malicious MCPs during the process... you didn't find any, right? OK, then we'll skip this question.

**Interviewer:** So, when you were reviewing the source code and assessing specific code patterns, function calls, or data processing methods, were there any particular ways that especially alerted you, or any parts that you found particularly difficult to understand?

**Interviewee:** (Network issue)

**Interviewer:** (Addressing network issue) Okay, I'll continue. When reviewing the source code, were there any specific code patterns or function calls that made you feel alerted or were difficult to understand?

**Interviewee:** I would be more cautious about places that update information or download files. For example, sometimes server configuration updates might download things, but I don't quite understand what exactly it's updating, and it might download something else. This would make me quite vigilant.

**Interviewer:** (Addressing network issue) It keeps cutting out, I'm not sure why. I'll switch to a different hotspot. It should be better now, it might have been my network just now.
Alright, after discussing these four questions, I'll explain the four types of attacks and methods involved in our malicious MCP servers.

**Interviewee:** Mmm.

**Interviewer:** Okay. The first one is about the Weather Server. This is the MCP Server for checking the weather. The initial part of its code doesn't have major issues; it's a normal weather check. The problem actually lies in, I don't know if you use VS Code? If you use VS Code, there's an overview on the right side.

**Interviewee:** Mmm.

**Interviewer:** And you can see that there's a function hidden at the very bottom. The purpose of this function is to communicate externally, to send out a packet, a request packet. That's one point. Another point is in this area, it seemingly looks like a harmless comment, without any threat. But the way this MCP package is implemented is that this comment, as a description, will be given to the large model, yes, to the large model. And actually, the problem is on the far right, a line is hidden on the far right, a piece of text for performing prompt injection on the large model is hidden on the far right. It would make the large model read `/etc/password`, which is a sensitive file, and then send out the sensitive file through that function at the very bottom. So, this server is an example of a malicious situation.

**Interviewee:** That's pretty vicious.

**Interviewer:** Right. And the next one is the Time Server, the MCP Server for checking time. It's actually a similar situation: it added text in the `description` field to deceive the large model into calling another tool called Wallet, which is a tool for transfers, blockchain transfers, and then instructs the large model to make malicious transfers to a certain address. The content of this `description` is also provided to the large model, and the large model might mistakenly believe this segment is the correct way to use some other tool. It's manipulated this way, thereby deceiving the large model.
The first type of attack we call a Tool Poisoning Attack; that is, the server itself is malicious, containing malicious prompts and malicious functions—it's an issue with the server itself. This is called a Tool Poisoning Attack.
The second one, the Time Server, where only the `description` has a strange piece of text, is called a Puppet Attack. The meaning of a Puppet Attack is that it manipulates other tools to achieve its desired outcome. It's like, in an environment with many MCP Servers, the content of this function manipulates another tool to do bad things, deceiving the large model into manipulating another tool to do bad things—that's a Puppet Attack.

**Interviewer:** And the next one is Google Map, the Google Maps. This part is actually quite complex: it defines a strange string of codes here, something called static encoding. This is actually something I just made up; it, it's something that will be translated into a URL, translated into an IP address, and then it performs a concatenation here, splicing these two strings into that IP address, and then sends a packet out through the underlying mechanism. Yes, that's how it works. It's hidden so that users can't spot it at a glance; you have to look closely.

**Interviewee:** It's disguised.

**Interviewer:** Exactly. Its situation is this: this malicious URL is not used to receive information like the first server, but to provide information. This function requests information from this URL, and then the attacker places the prepared prompts for prompt injection onto this URL. Then it retrieves the prompt and returns it to the large model, thereby achieving prompt injection into the large model. The difference between this and the first two attacks is that the server itself seems to have no issues; its `description` is normal. Neither our scanner, nor the attacker—no, nor the user—can see any problems; they might only see that it sent a request to a third party. But actually, the true attack payload is placed on a remote server. This is called a Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack.

**Interviewee:** Mmm.

**Interviewer:** OK. So those are the three attack methods. The fourth malicious server is called WeChat MCP, and its malicious method lies in its configuration information. Its configuration uses `npx -y @latest` and then `model_context_protocoI`. The "OI" is missing an "O", which means it's a non-official source. By continuously pulling the latest version with `@latest` in this way, the attacker can initially upload legitimate code and then later upload malicious code, achieving what's called a Pig Butchering Scam attack, or a rug pull.

**Interviewee:** Oh, you'd have to look quite carefully to spot that.

**Interviewer:** Yes, exactly. So, now that you've heard about these four attack types, how would you rank them in terms of their difficulty of exploitation or severity of harm?

**Interviewee:** I think the first two, to begin with, should be less harmful. Between those two, I think the first one might be even weaker, because if someone truly looked at the source code, and read it from beginning to end, it would be quite hard to overlook a block of code that's so far removed from its main body. And normally, it wouldn't be that far away, so being that far, it looks very suspicious and would indeed easily draw attention. And also, that description, with a large empty space in the middle after the prompt, is also visually designed to be unnoticeable. But assuming it is noticed, it would definitely seem very suspicious—why would a normal prompt be hidden like that? This one, I think, if you can see it, it should still be relatively easy to identify. But for the third one, starting from the third, it would probably involve understanding the specific logic of the thing. For example, if I don't have much coding background, I might have to go through that entire section to understand what the program is trying to do, and only then might I realize there's a danger. But it's also possible that after reading it, I wouldn't understand what it's doing, so I might not be able to identify it, I think. And the last one, I think, is similar; it also involves common names that might have a typo, so you might just glance over it out of habit and not easily notice it. I think the last one might be even more dangerous than the third.

**Interviewer:** Indeed. OK, OK. I understand what you mean. It's true that hiding malicious prompts like that in code is quite difficult, and if discovered, it would indeed be very easy for users to spot the problem. OK. Now let's move on to the second part, which is to ask for your views on the security of the MCP ecosystem. First, I'd like to ask whether you have considered, or would consider in the future, using AI Agents combined with MCP to manage your private data or resources, such as project source code, blockchain wallets, communication tools, and other important resources?

**Interviewee:** I think if it involves social media or economic-related things, such as blockchain wallets or payments, I probably wouldn't dare to actively use it. For code projects, I might choose to use it, for example, to create a front-end interface or something else.

**Interviewer:** OK, I understand. Then the next question is, you've used MCP before, right?

**Interviewee:** Mmm.

**Interviewer:** OK. And, while using MCP, applications like Cursor or ChatDev Studio, don't they generate alerts every time they execute prompts, telling you which MCP Server is about to be called, asking for your consent, and requesting permissions? Do you pay close attention to the operational details? Do you read them carefully?

**Interviewee:** The part I pay close attention to is limited to, for example, if it modified—assuming I'm using it to write a front-end—which part of the code it modified, and checking if it meets my functional expectations. But I don't necessarily observe how its permissions are declared.

**Interviewer:** Which MCP application did you use? Was it Cursor, as I mentioned, or something else?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I used Cursor before, and I used it to build a front-end.

**Interviewer:** OK, I see. Cursor, and it seems Cursor has an option, right? Once you select it, it won't pop up any more warnings or prompts, it just defaults to "agree" all the time, right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, yes, especially when not loading MCPs from other external editors. At least in my experience, when using it normally, it rarely brings up these things, especially regarding permissions.

**Interviewer:** OK. Alright, the next question is about MCP portal websites, like the one we simulated in our task. What role do you think they should play in ensuring user security? Or what key security metrics or information should they provide?

**Interviewee:** I hope these websites can implement stricter reviews. That is, when these users—or rather, these providers—upload their MCPs, they should probably be rigorously reviewed, perhaps from their source code and configurations. This might provide a bit more peace of mind.

**Interviewer:** So these websites should have an auditing process, right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, the threshold should be a bit higher. And if they update their content, I also hope there's a timely review for that too.

**Interviewer:** OK. Alright, what kind of features or measures do you hope to see in the future to improve MCP security risks?

**Interviewee:** First, I hope that on this platform, I can see user reviews after they've used it, and I hope these reviews can be verified as trustworthy. This way, if an MCP truly contains malicious software or a malicious program, if enough people use it, it should be identifiable. Or at least it should provide a reference.

**Interviewer:** I see, so like integrating a security review section for MCP code on such platforms, is that right?

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** OK. Alright, and finally, do you have any suggestions or areas for improvement regarding the overall design of this user study?

**Interviewee:** Overall, I don't think there are major issues. I just think that since these—what do you call them—these malicious MCPs have already been designed, I hope that when completing those tasks, the answers might be revealed at the end. That way, if I hadn't participated in this follow-up interview, I would still know what was going on, and I could also improve my own security awareness. Because truly, after completing it, if this hadn't been explained to me, I wouldn't have known how it was specifically implemented.

**Interviewer:** I understand, I understand what you mean. The design of our user study is that everyone who participates in the survey will have a follow-up interview, so everyone will know why there were malicious elements. Yes, yes, yes, for ethical considerations, we must tell them.

**Interviewee:** Right, no problem then. Also, about the platform itself. The platform, but I don't know much about it, so I'm not sure if this suggestion is useful, but if the platform could briefly demonstrate the MCP's operational process, it might be more intuitive. Because right now, it's basically purely looking at code, and if someone like me, who might not have very good coding skills, uses MCP precisely to avoid getting involved in specific code reading and writing. So, when actually using it, it might be difficult to carefully check if there are any issues with its source code, so yes, it's hard to identify them.

**Interviewer:** OK, I understand what you mean, we'll improve next time. Thank you again for participating in our interview. Our interview concludes here.
