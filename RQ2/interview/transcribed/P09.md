**Interviewer:** Hello, thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this interview.

**Interviewer:** First, in the first part, let's review the tasks we completed. The first question is, when you were browsing and installing servers on the simulated website, did any server arouse your suspicion, making you think it might be malicious?

**Interviewee:** No.

**Interviewer:** Okay, so no servers made you feel they were malicious. Then I'll skip to the next question: While browsing these MCP servers on the simulated website, how confident or certain were you in identifying potential malicious MCP servers?

**Interviewee:** Not confident.

**Interviewer:** Okay, so you weren't particularly confident about identifying malicious MCPs.

**Interviewee:** And malicious ones.

**Interviewer:** Okay, since you didn't find any malicious MCP servers during the task, I'll skip that question. The next question is, when you specifically looked at the source code, were there any specific code patterns or function calls that triggered your alert?

**Interviewee:** If I couldn't understand it, I just...

**Interviewer:** Alright, alright. Now, I will explain the four types of attacks and methods for these MCP servers, and then you can tell me which one you think is the most severe.

**Interviewer:** The first attack type, the first one is Visor MCP. Its problem is that it hides a malicious function at the end of the code, in an inconspicuous place, and this function communicates externally. Then, in its description, which is its docstring comment section, it also hides a segment of malicious description on the far right. This description will be fed to the large model (LLM), forming a prompt injection. We call this direct attack method "Tool Poisoning."

**Interviewer:** Then the second one is Temp Server. It explains in its description how to trick the large model (LLM) into changing its transfer address when calling another tool. That is, the user originally intended to transfer to address A, but through this malicious description, it tricks the large model (LLM) into thinking the user actually wants to transfer to address B. This means that in a multi-MCP Server environment, this MCP Server uses its description to indirectly inject and influence another normal MCP Server. In this scenario, the large model (LLM) becomes its puppet, and we call this "Puppet Attack."

**Interviewer:** OK. Then the next one is Google Map, the Google Map server. Its first problem lies in its description section. Its description states that it was created by "Googie." Yes, it masquerades as the official server, but it's not, deceiving users into believing it's official, thereby gaining their trust. Then, in its actual code, it hides a segment of malicious URL concatenation using unknown encoding. It then forms a malicious URL, initiates a request, and finally, the result returned by this malicious URL is directly returned to the large model (LLM). This means the attacker can place their malicious prompt on this third-party malicious URL. The advantage of this is that the code itself appears to be completely fine, with no malicious descriptions. If directly scanned, no issues would be found; one would only see it communicating externally. So, attackers can hide this malicious information on a third-party resource.

**Interviewer:** OK, and that's the third type. The fourth type is the WeChat MCP Server. The problem with this server is not in its code; its code is perfectly normal and has no issues. Its problem lies in its configuration information. Firstly, it uses `npx` to request information from a third-party source. You can see that the third-party source "model context protocol" has "protocol" misspelled, missing an 'O'. This means it's actually impersonating the official source; it's a third-party source, which users might not notice if they don't look closely. Additionally, it has `@latest` and `-y` appended. This means that every time a user executes this MCP Server, it will pull the latest code from this third-party hosting platform to execute. This creates a possibility for attackers: they might initially upload legitimate code, and after a period when users have used it and trust it, they then upload and overwrite it with malicious code. When the user executes it again, they find it's malicious and get attacked. We call this a "Rug Pull" attack, like a pig butchering scam.

**Interviewer:** OK, I've just explained these four types: first, Tool Poisoning; second, Puppet Attack; third, Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack; and fourth, Rug Pull. How would you rank these four attack types in terms of difficulty of exploitation and severity of harm?

**Interviewee:** I think the fourth type of attack is the most difficult to defend against. Because, as you said, it might initially have legitimate code, and then after some time, it updates with malicious code. Next is the third type of attack, this...

**Interviewer:** That is, Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack.

**Interviewee:** Yes, like this "Googie," if the 'L' were written as a '1', it would be even harder to notice. Yes, it would be unclear who the publisher is. For the remaining two attack methods, the first one seems a bit easier to identify. The second one might rank third, and the first one ranks fourth. That's roughly my ranking.


**Interviewer:** OK, I understand what you mean. The next part will ask for your views on MCP security and ecosystem security. Would you consider using AI Agents combined with MCP in the past or future to manage your private data or resources, such as project source code or blockchain wallets?

**Interviewee:** I would have considered it in the past, but after hearing what you said, I might not consider it in the future.

**Interviewer:** OK. The next question is, have you used MCP before?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I have.

**Interviewer:** When you used MCP, did you carefully examine the prompt messages and permission requests for each execution of the MCP application?

**Interviewee:** No.

**Interviewer:** You wouldn't pay attention? Would you carefully focus on its operational details?

**Interviewee:** No, as long as it runs successfully, that's fine.

**Interviewer:** Oh, what if there's an error? Would you pay attention then?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I would.

**Interviewer:** Okay. OK, then the next question is, the type of website we simulated in our task, we call it a portal website or an app marketplace, etc. What role do you think such a website should play in ensuring user safety?

**Interviewee:** It should conduct a security review for the applications.

**Interviewer:** OK, so it should provide security metrics like audit reports for users to refer to, right?

**Interviewee:** I might not necessarily refer to those if I were a user; I think it should guarantee the security of the website itself.

**Interviewer:** OK. The next question is, what kind of information, features, or verification mechanisms do you think could significantly enhance your trust in an MCP server?

**Interviewee:** Perhaps, perhaps it still needs a security rating.

**Interviewer:** So, the official server platform gives each server a security score, right? But what if the platform itself is malicious, or if it's a negligent platform, what then?

**Interviewee:** Then I wouldn't dare to use that platform.

**Interviewer:** But you wouldn't know, would you?

**Interviewee:** Then I think that's a very serious problem.

**Interviewer:** OK, you think it's a very serious problem, so the security of third-party platforms needs to be ensured.

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** OK, then what kind of features or measures do you expect in the future to improve the security risks of MCP?

**Interviewee:** I still hope for source code audits.

**Interviewer:** OK. OK, do you have any suggestions or areas for improvement regarding the overall design of this user study?

**Interviewee:** I think it's very well done. This is the most perfect survey I've ever taken.

**Interviewer:** Thank you for your recognition. Thank you again for investing your time and effort in participating in this user study interview. This interview concludes now.
