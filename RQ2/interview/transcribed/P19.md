**Interviewer:** Thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this interview. For the first part, let's review the previous task. When you were browsing and installing servers on our simulated website, did any servers raise your suspicion, making you think they might be malicious? What aspects specifically caused your suspicion?

**Interviewee:** I felt that some servers with very brief descriptions might be malicious. In that regard, I found them somewhat suspicious.

**Interviewer:** OK, so you found the descriptions suspicious. The next question is, when you were browsing the MCP servers within the simulated website, how confident were you in identifying potentially malicious MCP servers?

**Interviewee:** Actually, my confidence wasn't particularly high. This is because each MCP server might have certain descriptions or content, and the pages contained a large amount of information. I didn't have much time to meticulously review them step-by-step.

**Interviewer:** OK. The third question is, you discovered the malicious nature of the time server during the previous task. How did you determine that these MCP servers were malicious?

**Interviewee:** At that time, I saw that the way its description was written wasn't conventional. After careful reading, I discovered it had an issue.

**Interviewer:** So, you felt the source code was most useful for you in identifying malicious behavior?

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** Alright. Then, when you subsequently reviewed the source code, were there any specific code patterns, function calls, or data processing methods that particularly put you on alert?

**Interviewee:** Initially, I was more focused on situations where it requested third-party APIs. For the code of some MCP servers that involved third-party APIs, I would try to check if that API had any issues. But in practice, I didn't find many unusual things during the review process.

**Interviewer:** So, you would specifically focus on requests like 'request' calls?

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** Alright. Since we've already explained the four types of malicious MCP server attacks to you, we'll skip that part here. So, how would you rank Tool Poisoning Attack, Puppet Attack, Rug Pull, and Malicious Third-Party Resources in terms of their difficulty of exploitation and their severity of harm?

**Interviewee:** If we're talking about the most difficult to exploit, I would still say Tool Poisoning Attack. Because some other attacks that operate directly through the server might be relatively more obvious. However, if it involves constructing a very covert description or code manipulation, such an attack would be harder to detect and more complex to exploit.

**Interviewer:** So, you feel these types of covert attacks are very difficult to exploit?

**Interviewee:** Yes, exactly.

**Interviewer:** And in terms of severity of harm, which ones do you think are the highest?

**Interviewee:** I believe the highest in terms of harm severity is likely Rug Pull. Because it can be unexpected. For example, after your initial installation, you wouldn't expect your subsequent account might be replaced with a malicious one. If a deeper subsequent review isn't performed, it can easily lead to serious consequences.

**Interviewer:** Alright. So you think the ranking for severity of harm should be: Rug Pull, then Malicious Third-Party Resources, and then which two?

**Interviewee:** Then Puppet Attack, and finally Tool Poisoning Attack.

**Interviewer:** So Puppet Attack and Tool Poisoning Attack. OK, I understand.

**Interviewer:** Alright. For the next part, have you considered, or would you consider in the future, using AI Agents combined with MCPs to manage your private data or resources, such as project source code, blockchain wallets, or other crucial content?

**Interviewee:** Personally, I would not consider it for now. I haven't used AI Agents with MCPs for management in the past, and I probably won't consider it for the time being in the future, as the security concerns still seem quite significant.

**Interviewer:** OK. Alright, then in your past use of MCPs, would you carefully review the prompt messages or permission request information from the MCP application for each execution?

**Interviewee:** Not really. Sometimes, I'd simply ignore them, considering it too much trouble.

**Interviewer:** Would you pay attention to its operational details? For example, specifically which server or tool it called, and at what stage it was?

**Interviewee:** No, I wouldn't.

**Interviewer:** Alright. For MCP portal websites like the one we simulated in our task, what role do you think these types of websites should play in ensuring user security? What key security indicators or information should they provide to users to gain their trust?

**Interviewee:** They should clearly assign security ratings to MCP servers. Aggregation websites like these should act as security auditors. After all, they are traffic entry points, with a large number of users obtaining their desired MCP servers through them. Therefore, they must provide relatively detailed or prominent security indicators and other information.

**Interviewer:** Alright. Then, as a user, when selecting a suitable MCP server, whether through a portal website or GitHub, what kind of information, features, or verification mechanisms would significantly boost your trust?

**Interviewee:** First, whether there's something like a security score. If it has a good security score, I would relatively trust that MCP server. Secondly, it's important to look at the popularity of the MCP server. Some aggregation websites place popular MCP servers in a more prominent position. If it's very popular and many people are using it, I might temporarily assume it has no security issues, since so many people are using it without incident. This would increase my trust in it.

**Interviewer:** What kind of features or measures do you expect in the future to improve the security risks associated with MCP servers during their application process?

**Interviewee:** I personally believe a gateway would be quite suitable. During runtime, if critical operations or information could be very clearly prompted to the user, I think it would be quite effective.

**Interviewer:** OK. Finally, do you have any suggestions or areas you think could be improved regarding the overall design of this user study?

**Interviewee:** No.

**Interviewer:** Alright, then thank you again for investing your time and effort in this user study.
