**Interviewer:** Alright, thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this interview. Let's first review the tasks we completed earlier. Initially, when you were browsing the simulated website and installing servers, were there any servers that raised your suspicion? Specifically, what aspects made you find them suspicious?

**Interviewee:** First, I looked at the descriptions of many servers, and I felt that from the descriptions alone, it was impossible to tell if they were malicious. For example, based on the functional descriptions, I didn't feel I could differentiate. However, there was one suspicious point, and I wonder if others would feel the same way. Because it was a small website, when I clicked on it, it would say, for example, that the creator of a certain WeChat MCP was Tencent Official. This made me feel very strange. If the website were GitHub or Hugging Face, and it claimed to be made by Tencent, and I could click to see the team information, I might not have questions. But if it's a third-party website I've never heard of before, claiming its creator is Tencent Official, I would find that very strange.



**Interviewer:** I understand your point, it's mainly the descriptive information or some of the provided information that made you feel certain aspects were suspicious, right?

**Interviewee:** I think it's unlikely that Tencent would publish its MCP on an unknown website, that's what I thought.



**Interviewer:** Your point is very valid. So the second question is, later, in the process of searching for malicious MCP servers, how confident or certain were you in being able to identify potentially malicious MCP servers? What was your confidence level?

**Interviewee:** I don't think I had confidence. The MCP descriptions on these websites all looked very legitimate; they didn't feel like they could be malicious websites.



**Interviewer:** Okay. Third question, didn't you find a malicious MCP server? How did you determine it was malicious?

**Interviewee:** You mean how I judged it by looking at the code, not by using it, right?



**Interviewer:** Correct.

**Interviewee:** This is how it is: when I looked at its source code, I found some strange parts. For example, it would deliberately place a function at the very bottom, as if it really didn't want you to see it. Some of its prompts were handled in a similar way, giving a "something unusual must be suspicious" feeling. If I were just using this thing, I might glance at the code, scan it, and if it seemed okay, I wouldn't pay much attention. But when I saw why something was placed so far down, it made me curious, wanting to see what it was and why it was hidden there.



**Interviewer:** So, you're saying that among the introduction and description information, and the source code configuration method, you found the source code to be the most useful for determining if it was malicious?

**Interviewee:** I think the source code is the most useful.



**Interviewer:** Okay. The next question is, you also mentioned that you pay special attention to certain things when looking at the source code. Would you specifically look for certain code patterns, function calls, or data processing methods? For code patterns, you just mentioned you might look at those placed particularly low. As for function calls or data processing methods, were there any specific patterns you looked for to make your judgment?

**Interviewee:** Yes. For example, it might have some unreasonable encoding; it deliberately encodes an unknown website using Base64. I found that very strange because no one should do that. You'd notice at a glance that this URL uses Base64, which I don't think is a common format, so it's quite abnormal. Then, regarding data processing, for instance, if it has something that requires my API in a JSON file to send a message, I would find that quite odd. Like, who are you sending my API to? You're not going to sell it, are you? I feel like that easily makes one suspect malicious intent.



**Interviewer:** Indeed. Now, I'll explain the four types of malicious MCP servers we designed and how they implement their attack types. These are four attack types and their means. First, this website is one we created ourselves; it's not real, and it hosts some simulated MCP servers.
The first malicious one is the Weather MCP server. As you mentioned, it hides a function at the very bottom. This function is designed to send out information; it sends the API Key to an unknown URL. That's its first malicious point. Its second malicious point is that the description, or docstring, looks perfectly normal, just an innocent comment. However, at its very right end, a hidden description is embedded. This description instructs the large language model (LLM) to read the API, ETC password, by calling a tool, and then transmit the API Key after reading it. So, this attack method involves the server itself being malicious, containing malicious descriptions, and possessing malicious functionality. We call this "Tool Poisoning." That's the first type.
The second is the Time Server. A key aspect of this Time Server is in the description of a tool, where a strange text is placed. This text instructs the LLM, when it calls a cryptocurrency wallet transfer tool, to redirect the transfer address from the user's intended address to "0x123123", claiming it's a private relay, but in reality, it's all deceptive. This method, in many MCP Server environments, uses prompt injection via descriptions to trick the LLM, manipulating it to become the attacker's puppet, calling legitimate servers to perform malicious actions. In this scenario, we call it a "Puppet Attack." At this point, the LLM acts as the attacker's puppet; it can call any normal tool but is made to do harmful things. For example, it could make a system management tool delete important system files, which falls under this category.
The next malicious server is Google Map. Your point about "Tencent Official" being wrong is actually very insightful. There is indeed an incorrect detail here: the creator of this Google Map is not "Google"; it's "Googlie." This is designed to trick users into thinking it's official when it's not at all. It's truly hard to notice if you don't look carefully. Specifically, its attack method involves defining a string of strange static encoding at a certain position around line 400. This encoded string is also reverse-decoded (or decrypted) into a malicious URL. It's more complex than Base64; it's a manual decoding. After decoding, two code segments are concatenated to get a third-party URL. Then, it requests information from this URL and returns the information received from that URL, unchanged, back to the LLM. What is this behavior doing? It means the attacker can put all the prompts they want to inject onto this third-party server, which users cannot see or detect. This server then acts as a trampoline or relay, relaying the malicious description unchanged back to the LLM. This method achieves a relatively covert injection. In other words, when users or scanners scan this server's code, they won't detect any malicious descriptions or prompts; they won't find them because the injection is dynamically performed at runtime. This is how this method is implemented. We call this attack method "Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack." It relies on third-party resources rather than local ones.
The fourth malicious server is the WeChat MCP. It is indeed malicious, but its maliciousness is not in its source code, which is fine. Instead, its configuration method has some issues. First, it uses the same old method: it pulls from a third-party source, and it calls it "model context protocol," but "protocol" is misspelled, missing an 'O.' It should be "TOCOL," but here it's "TCOL." This is a method of impersonating an official source, tricking users into thinking it's pulled from an official, legitimate source if they don't look carefully, when in fact, it's the attacker's own source. Then, it uses the `npx -y @latest` command. What does this combined command represent? `-y` means that every request during this execution will be automatically approved ("yes"), so the user doesn't need to manually type 'Y'; it will default to 'yes.' And `@latest` means that every time the user executes this command, it pulls the latest code. Each time this MCP Server is run, it pulls and uses the latest code. This creates a possibility: an attacker initially uploads normal, problem-free code. Users use it for a while, find no issues, and trust the server. Then, one day, the attacker uploads malicious code, and when the user uses it again, the malicious code is pulled from this third-party hosting platform and executed. This completes an attack. We call this type of attack "Rug Pull," which is a type of supply chain attack, or "pig butchering scam." Do you understand this attack method? Any questions?



**Interviewee:** Understood. Could using a download method like `pip install` avoid this situation?



**Interviewer:** Well, it's not `npx` itself, this is `npx`, so it's from `npm`. The MCP Servers now use more Python commands like `uvx`, where `uv` is a package manager, and `uvx` completely mimics `npx`. Anyway, similar problems will still exist. So, if you use `pip`, `pip` itself also pulls from hosting platforms, which is essentially a supply chain attack. All these possibilities exist. Now that you've heard about these four attack types, how would you rank them in terms of exploitation difficulty and severity of harm?



**Interviewee:** The first one, the first one was Tool Poisoning.



**Interviewer:** Tool Poisoning.



**Interviewee:** Tool Poisoning is when it sends a message and uploads my API, right? Is that what Tool Poisoning is called?



**Interviewer:** Yes, that action. The server itself is malicious. Meaning, the server's code itself contains malicious code, that's it.



**Interviewee:** Okay. Then Puppet Attack, that's a malicious one, and Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack. What kind of consequences would the Google one, the Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack, cause? The Google one.



**Interviewer:** The consequences would also be, well, actually similar to what the first two tools can cause. The text it returns to the LLM would cause a prompt injection, thereby interfering with the LLM's normal operations. It might cause the LLM to return incorrect results, which is the mildest outcome, or it could even lead the LLM to use legitimate tools to perform more severe actions. All these are possible.



**Interviewee:** In terms of severity, I think the Google one should be the highest. No, no, no, let me think. I think the Supply Chain Attack should be the highest. This generally feels unlikely to be detected; it's like a blind spot. You wouldn't normally think there would be foul play there. I feel it might be a bit more significant. I think this is where the biggest threat comes from, precisely because it's an area you don't pay attention to. It's not about how flashy the attack is, but rather that you're unaware of this thing, you don't pay attention to it, and then in a certain version, for example, it uploads something malicious, you don't know what it's for, but you just update it normally. I think that's quite frightening. Then, for the second highest severity, I think it should be the Google one. Its stealth is quite strong. So I believe its strong stealth also contributes to a higher degree of harm. As for the remaining Puppet Attack and Tool Poisoning, let me think. Puppet Attack uses some, but in the prompt...



**Interviewer:** Yes, it's about doing some prompt injection in the description part of the tool.



**Interviewee:** Oh, then I think the Puppet Attack should be the lowest, because the prompt is too easy to spot. I think it seems there's no way to completely hide its prompt; as long as it writes the prompt, then it's, it's very easy to be discovered. And Tool Poisoning is a bit above that. I think that's their ranking of harm severity.



**Interviewer:** I understand what you mean. So the most severe is the Rug Pull, which is the supply chain attack, followed by the Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack as the second most severe, then Tool Poisoning as the third, and the Puppet Attack as the fourth.



**Interviewee:** I think it's about not paying enough attention.



**Interviewer:** Okay, understood. That concludes this task review section. Now, the second part is about your views on MCP ecosystem security. The first question is, in the past or in the future, would you consider using AI Agents combined with MCP to manage your private data or resources? For example, blockchain wallets, project source code, personal notes, and so on.



**Interviewee:** If I were to use some official AI Agents, would that still count as using MCP? For example, using some official built-in ones, like Copilot in VS Code for code review, then the AI integration in Codium, and also Notion for note-taking, Notion also has something similar to an AI. If its API provider is official, and I don't need to provide an API, does that count as AI Agent plus MCP?



**Interviewer:** Yes, it does. They have MCP services, including Copilot; it has MCP services.



**Interviewee:** Oh, it can have MCP services. Yes, I use this, I use this. I just haven't used my own API to do this. And also, I remember I also have something like Zotero, I think. Zotero also has an option to upload your own API, but I haven't used it much. So, generally these, these might be used. Did you say Copilot can use its own API? For example...



**Interviewer:** Yes, that's also available. Copilot, the plugin, right? Copilot indeed has it. You see, for example, once you switch to Agent mode, it has an MCP function.



**Interviewee:** Oh. Yes, then I guess I have used it.



**Interviewer:** Yes, you can. So, have you used MCP services in the past?



**Interviewee:** Hmm, then I suppose I have.



**Interviewer:** You have, right? And when you used it, did you carefully check the application's prompts and permission requests for each execution? Because doesn't it pop up a box asking if you agree to this action and so on? Did you pay attention to that?



**Interviewee:** No. I generally don't. I don't check carefully, nor do I pay much attention to its operational details, as long as it succeeds.



**Interviewer:** As long as it works, I generally don't care what it's doing.



**Interviewer:** Okay, I understand your point. Alright, the next question is, like the simulated MCP website in our task, isn't it a kind of MCP Server portal or app marketplace? So, what role do you think such a website should play in ensuring user safety? What key security indicators and information should it provide to users?



**Interviewee:** I think it should at least provide code auditing.



**Interviewer:** Okay, so they should provide audit reports to prove that the server is safe, and so on.



**Interviewer:** Yes, yes, audit reports are a very good indicator.



**Interviewer:** Hmm, okay. Uh, and the next question is, what kind of information, features, or verification mechanisms do you think, as a user currently selecting a suitable MCP Server, would significantly increase your trust in that server?



**Interviewee:** Source authentication, that is, source authentication. For example, if there's a server, say it's from Google, and it authenticates itself as Google, then I would definitely believe that a large company wouldn't do something so low-down. Even if it were Tencent, it wouldn't stoop to that level. So, if it has authentication, I think I would trust it quite a bit.



**Interviewer:** Understood. Alright, and finally, the last question for this section is, what kind of features and measures do you expect in the future to improve the security risks for users employing MCPs?



**Interviewee:** Regarding features and measures, I still feel it's code auditing. I believe code auditing is a more, more endorsed, a more backed-up method. That's how I feel.



**Interviewer:** Okay, so, for example, the release of automated source code auditing tools, and so on?



**Interviewer:** Yes, are there service providers specifically for code auditing? For example, this is essentially a transfer of responsibility, right? If a user uses this website and its MCP has an issue, naturally, the website would be responsible. But if the website says, "We've hired a service provider to audit for us," and that's their responsibility, then they can essentially disclaim responsibility. At least there would be an endorsement. Are there such service providers that can offer this level of service?


**Interviewee:** That makes a lot of sense. This is actually quite common in the blockchain domain. Every smart contract deployed on the blockchain invites auditing companies to issue an audit report. Then, if there are any issues, you can just trouble those security companies. Uh, indeed, this could be introduced to the MCP Server side. Hmm, it's certainly a good suggestion. Okay, and the last question is, do you have any suggestions or areas you think could be improved regarding the overall design of this user study?



**Interviewer:** It's about Task 2; I think we didn't look too closely, we didn't scrutinize it enough. That part could be explained a bit more clearly, I think that would be great. And the task design itself was quite interesting. Overall, it was very engaging.


**Interviewee:** Okay, thank you for your affirmation. Okay, thank you again for your time and effort in participating in this user study and interview. This interview concludes here.
