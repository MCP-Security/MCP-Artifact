**Interviewer:** Thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this interview. For the first part, let's review the tasks you completed earlier: When you were browsing and installing servers on our simulated website, did any servers raise your suspicion? If so, what specifically made you suspicious?

**Interviewee:** No servers raised my suspicion.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Then, the next question is, when you were browsing the MCP servers on these simulated websites, how confident were you in identifying potentially malicious MCP servers?

**Interviewee:** I think my confidence would be relatively low. Mainly because I wouldn't examine them too closely.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Alright, then the next task is, since you didn't find any malicious MCP servers during the task, we'll skip this question. Okay, question number four is, if you were to carefully examine the source code in Task 3, were there any specific code patterns, function calls, or data processing methods that would particularly alert you?

**Interviewee:** If there were, it would probably be things like certain tool calls, or instructions that weren't what I had provided.

**Interviewer:** Okay, understood.

**Interviewer:** Next, I'll introduce you to the four types of malicious MCP servers we set up, along with their attack types and methods.

The first malicious MCP server is the Weather MCP server, used for weather queries. The main issue with its `server.py` source code is that it appears normal when viewed superficially, but in reality, a hidden piece of code is embedded in a function at the very bottom of the right-hand overview pane. This function communicates externally and sends out some data. The specific content sent is actually implemented via a `docstring`. This `docstring` looks like a normal description on the surface, but its far-right side hides a piece of text that instructs the large language model to read sensitive files like `/etc/password` and pass the content to the function. This means that although the `docstring` appears to be a comment, due to the `mcp.tool` decorator, it will be sent to the large language model as a tool description. Attackers can leverage this to achieve prompt injection, thereby disrupting large model operations or stealing user privacy. We call this attack method Tool Poisoning Attack (TPA). This server itself is malicious, contains strange descriptive information, prompt injection, and some of its functions are also malicious.

Then, the second malicious server is Time. The issue with Time is relatively easy to spot: in the `description` part of its tool definition, a strange command is appended. This is also a command for injection, instructing the large language model to change the user-specified recipient address for blockchain transfers to `0x123123` when calling this tool. This is manipulating the large language model to perform malicious actions. This type of attack, applicable in scenarios where multiple MCP servers are deployed in a user's environment, uses an indirect injection within the `description`. Within this malicious tool, by deceiving or manipulating the large language model into driving benign tools to do bad things, we call it a Puppet Attack. The large language model becomes the attacker's puppet. It can drive the large language model to call normal tools to perform malicious actions, which is also achieved during the description phase. We call this the Puppet Attack.

Okay, those are the first two. The third is Google Maps. First, in its description information, there's a point: its creator is not called Google; it's called Googlie, which confuses users, making them think it might be a third-party server impersonating an official one. Then, specifically in its code, it defines some strange parameters in one of its functions, for example, two strings here claiming to be static location codes. This might lead inexperienced users to believe these are essential variables needed by the map, but in fact, this code will decode them into a malicious URL, which it then concatenates and sends a request to. This attack method is what we call a Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack. This means the URL itself is malicious, and when requesting this URL, the attacker can put the payload, the payload used for prompt injection, onto this malicious URL. Thus, the code running locally on the user's machine doesn't show significant issues; there are no pre-written `description` or `prompt` details, but they are all placed on a third-party URL inaccessible to the user. This means the local server becomes a springboard for the attacker, and the attack is achieved through this method. We call this a Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack.

Then, the fourth is WeChat MCP, which is also malicious. Its maliciousness isn't in its code, which is quite normal and problem-free. Its malicious point lies in its configuration file. First, in the configuration file, the source for its installation is also problematic; the `Protocol` in `Model Context Protocol` is misspelled, missing an 'O'. Yes, it's an impersonation to make users think, if they don't look carefully, that it's an official source, when it's actually a third-party source.
And the second threat point might be the `npx -y` followed by `@latest`. This creates a problem: every time the user executes this server, this command will be executed, and it will attempt to retrieve the latest version from this third-party hosting platform, download it if available, and then execute it. This possibility, this creates the potential for a Rug Pull attack for the attacker. The attacker can first upload a normal code with no functional issues, and after the user uses it for a while and finds it good, they trust the tool. Then, after some time, the attacker uploads malicious code to perform a Rug Pull, which is like a "pig butchering scam," a Rug Pull attack.

**Interviewer:** Okay, then these four attack methods are: the first is Tool Poisoning Attack, the second is Puppet Attack, the third is Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack, and the fourth is Rug Pull. Considering both the difficulty of exploitation and the severity of harm, how would you rank their severity?

**Interviewee:** I feel that the first two (Tool Poisoning Attack and Puppet Attack) have the highest severity, followed by the third (Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack) and fourth (Rug Pull attack).

**Interviewer:** Okay, understood. Okay, okay, okay, alright, then this part is done. The next part is about your views on MCP ecosystem security. That is, in the past or in the future, would you consider using AI Agents combined with MCP to manage your private data or resources, such as project source code, personal notes, blockchain wallets, etc.?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I would.

**Interviewer:** You would consider it, right?

**Interviewee:** That's right.

**Interviewer:** Good. Then the next question is, in the past, have you used MCP before?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I have.

**Interviewer:** You've used it, right?

**Interviewee:** Yes. But I would look at the prompt information, though I wouldn't pay too much attention to the operational details.

**Interviewer:** Understood. Okay, then the next question is, for a real MCP portal website, similar to the one simulated in our task, what role do you think such a real portal website should play in ensuring user security? What kind of security indicators and information should it provide to earn your trust?

**Interviewee:** At the very least, there should be a security scan or security audit before these MCPs can be deployed on the website.

**Interviewer:** And the website would indicate that it has passed a security audit or similar, right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, that's right, yes.

**Interviewer:** I understand what you mean, okay. The next question is, from your perspective as a user, what kind of information, features, or verification mechanisms would make you particularly trust an MCP server when you are choosing one?

**Interviewee:** Firstly, it should be widely used, and secondly, it should come from official, well-known development teams. Yes, those are probably my main two points.

**Interviewer:** Okay. So, ideally, there should be some kind of certification for the source, confirming it's genuinely from an official party.

**Interviewee:** Yes, and if there's a security rating, I might also refer to that.

**Interviewer:** Alright. The last question, the last question for this part, is: what kind of features or measures would you expect in the future to improve the security risks during its operation?

**Interviewee:** I think all three measures are quite good and critical. Namely, sandboxing, gateways, and security auditing.

**Interviewer:** Sandboxing, gateways, and source code auditing, you think are all very important.

**Interviewee:** Yes, that's right, yes.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Alright, then for the last question, do you have any suggestions or areas you think could be improved regarding the overall design of this user study?

**Interviewee:** There are no areas that can be improved.

**Interviewer:** Oh, so it's already very good.

**Interviewee:** Yes, yes, it's very comprehensive.

**Interviewer:** Thank you for your recognition. Thank you again for taking the time and effort to participate in this user research interview.
