**Interviewer:** Thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this interview. In the first part, let's review the previous tasks. The first question is, when you were browsing and installing servers on the simulated website, were there any servers that raised your suspicion? What aspects made you suspicious of them?

**Interviewee:** They all looked quite normal to me. However, at first glance, the WeChat MCP seemed a bit problematic. Without looking at any feature descriptions or source code, because this MCP involves some personal information from WeChat, it could bring some security risks.

**Interviewer:** The next question is, when you were browsing these MCP servers on the simulated website, how confident were you in identifying these potentially malicious MCP servers?

**Interviewee:** Not very confident. Because when I first started using MCPs, I probably wouldn't think of them as malicious, unless someone explicitly told me about it, then I would consider if there were any malicious behaviors.

**Interviewer:** Next question, during the task, you found three malicious MCP servers in the task list. How did you determine that these MCP servers were malicious? What methods did you use to discover them?

**Interviewee:** The WeChat one was based on intuition at the time; I felt it might have some issues, and then I could discern some things. As for the others, like the Time server, I didn't notice it at first. It was only after the task prompted that these MCPs were malicious that I checked the source code and found the problems.

**Interviewer:** Mainly by looking at the source code?

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** So, you think source code information is most useful for identifying malicious behavior.

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** Later, when you specifically examined the source code, were there any specific code patterns, function calls, or data processing methods that you paid special attention to because you found them suspicious?

**Interviewee:** Regarding function calls, as long as it involves function calls to LLMs, especially some descriptive statements, I would definitely look at them. These places are very likely to contain injected content.

**Interviewer:** Understood. Next, I'll explain the four types of maliciousness and methods we designed for these MCP servers.
The first one is the Weather server you discovered. It indeed has two malicious points: first, a suspicious function is placed at the very bottom of the code, which sends out requests to transmit some information; second, on the far right of its docstring (this part is fed to the LLM), there's a descriptive phrase used for prompt injection, which tricks the LLM into reading `/etc/passwd` and then transmitting it through the function below, achieving user privacy theft. We call this type of server, which is directly malicious in itself, "Tool Poisoning."

The second is the Time server. Clearly, in the description part of its tool, there's a malicious prompt for injection, which instructs the LLM to call a wallet transfer tool to carry out fund theft operations. This kind of attack, where one server (through its description injection) is manipulated to call another tool to achieve a malicious purpose within an MCP server environment, we call "Puppet Attack," with other tools becoming its puppets.

The third type is the Google Maps server. It has two discovery points: first, in the description phase, its uploader wrote "Googie" instead of "Google" to mimic the official name and deceive users. Second, its source code contains a section that defines some strange static encoding. This encoding decodes into a malicious third-party URL (API Host), which is then requested later. This third-party URL returns malicious content to the LLM. This means attackers don't need to inject poison into the code itself; they just put the malicious prompt into a third-party API, and the server requests the result and returns it verbatim to the LLM. We call this "Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack." In this method, the code itself might be fine, and detection would only show it making requests to a third-party API.

The fourth malicious one is WeChat MCP. Its malicious method is not in the source code (the source code itself might be fine and long, making it hard to audit), but rather in its configuration method. It requires a configuration method of `npx -y @latest`. This means that every time a user runs this server, it pulls the latest version from a third-party hosting platform. An attacker can first release a normal version, and after users start using it, they can replace the code on the platform with malicious code. When users execute the pull again, they will pull the malicious code locally, achieving a "Rug Pull" attack.

**Interviewer:** After hearing the introduction to these four attack types, how would you rank the difficulty of exploitation and the severity of harm for these four attacks?

**Interviewee:** Personally, I feel that calling the one requesting an unknown URL (i.e., Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack) poses a greater threat.

**Interviewer:** Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack.

**Interviewee:** Yes, because after requesting that URL, we have absolutely no idea what operations that server will perform.

**Interviewer:** Indeed. Let's move to the second part, regarding your views on MCP ecosystem security, mainly some subjective personal questions. The first one is, would you consider using an AI Agent plus MCP approach to manage your private data or resources, such as project source code or blockchain wallets, in the past or future?

**Interviewee:** It depends on the scenario. For sensitive scenarios like blockchain wallets, I probably wouldn't use it, but for some others, like personal notes, I might.

**Interviewer:** Next question, have you used MCP services before?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I have.

**Interviewer:** And when you used it, which MCP application was it implemented with? Was it Cursor or something else?

**Interviewee:** I've somewhat forgotten, I think it was the MCP that implemented Google search.

**Interviewer:** The Google search MCP, I'm not entirely sure about that one either. Do you recall if, during your use, it popped up any permission requests or warning messages, informing you that a window for a certain MCP server was about to be executed?

**Interviewee:** I don't think so.

**Interviewer:** No pop-ups, then? Do you pay close attention to the operational details of the entire MCP process?

**Interviewee:** No, I don't. Before using it, I might briefly check the project information to confirm if it's official and secure, but when actually using it, I wouldn't pay much attention to the details.

**Interviewer:** Next question, regarding the simulated MCP portal websites in our task (whether an app market or an aggregation website), what role do you think such real websites should play in ensuring user security? What key information should they provide?

**Interviewee:** Do you mean intermediate websites for MCP servers, i.e., website platforms that provide such services? Or do you mean websites that enumerate many MCP servers for users to choose from?

**Interviewer:** Yes, I mean the latter, which enumerates many servers for users to choose from.

**Interviewee:** Oh, I see. These types of websites should perform security audits on each MCP server in the aspects you mentioned earlier (such as configuration methods, source code, publishers, etc.).

**Interviewer:** So, you hope they can provide information about the server's publisher and conduct some official certification?

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** Then, if you were choosing an MCP server, what kind of information, features, or verification mechanisms would make you trust that MCP server?

**Interviewee:** First, based on functionality. If it involves many sensitive operations, my trust in it naturally wouldn't be high. Assuming the functionality is acceptable, I would pay attention to the MCP's source, primarily its source, and also look at user reviews.

**Interviewer:** Alright. The last question for this section is, what kind of features or measures do you expect to improve security risks when using MCP in the future?

**Interviewee:** As mentioned before, I hope there can be relevant auditing work for all the aspects you discussed, to ensure their security.

**Interviewer:** For the last part, do you have any suggestions or areas you think could be improved regarding the overall design of this user study or the questionnaire?

**Interviewee:** I don't think so, I think it's quite good.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Finally, thank you again for dedicating your time and effort to participate in this interview.
