**Interviewer:** Thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this interview. For the first part, let's review the three tasks you completed earlier. The first task was, when you were browsing and installing services on the simulated website, without being told they were malicious, did any servers raise your suspicion, making you feel they might be malicious?

**Interviewee:** When I saw these services before, I didn't suspect they were malicious. Because they looked, whether it was the URL or the entire website, quite like an official MCP service store, so at the time, I didn't have much suspicion about whether they were malicious.

**Interviewer:** So when you made your choices, you didn't consider security aspects, only functionality?

**Interviewee:** Right.

**Interviewer:** Then, for the second question, while browsing these MCP servers on the simulated website, how confident were you in identifying potentially malicious MCP servers?

**Interviewee:** Actually, I wasn't very confident. Because even though I might be from a computer-related major, it's easy to be careless during use. And my professional direction isn't particularly biased towards the security field, so I might not pay much attention to this aspect, and my online security awareness isn't very strong, making it difficult to detect.

**Interviewer:** So, since you discovered two malicious MCP servers during the task, how did you determine that these MCP servers were malicious? That is, you found the Weather and WeChat MCPs.

**Interviewee:** Mm.

**Interviewer:** How did you discover that these two were malicious? Through what method? How did you find them?

**Interviewee:** For the Weather one, first, I checked its source code. Because generally, if there are some malicious implementations, they should be implemented within the source code. When I pulled this source code locally, the VS Code editor helped; it provides an overview of the total lines of code in the right sidebar. Then I saw a very hidden code snippet at the very bottom of the code. After examining this part of the code, its format was very unusual to begin with, and then looking at the specific content, I discovered this anomaly.
Another anomaly was in its `getCurrentWeather` function. At that time, while inadvertently examining the code and scrolling horizontally, I found that at the right end, after many spaces, it had written some very hidden prompts. Anyway, both were discovered by checking the source code and some uncommon source code patterns.
For the other one, which should be the WeChat message sending MCP, it's because in this type of MCP client, installing services involves pulling the source code locally and then installing based on that source code. However, its service configuration's installation method was based on an `npx` service, so the service you actually installed had no relation to the source code you pulled locally. This could lead to some malicious code being placed in the `latest` version.

**Interviewer:** So, out of the three types of information—introduction and description, source code, and configuration method—which one do you think was most useful for you in judging malicious behavior?

**Interviewee:** I think it must be the configuration method, as it's quite direct, essentially the source code. Because for developers, unusual snippets in the source code should be relatively easy to spot.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Then later, as you carefully examined the source code, did you specifically look for certain code patterns, or function call methods, or data processing methods, etc.? Did you specifically search for these particular patterns?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I would. Especially when it involves calling APIs, there are common patterns like API private key leakage, or the specific URL address you are calling. Because these are relatively common patterns that might leak personal privacy, I would specifically check for these.

**Interviewer:** Understood. And because we've previously explained the four types of attack methods for MCP servers to you. Like the Weather server you found, it had malicious code at the very bottom that could leak user API Keys. The second, the Time server, would 'poison' the description – that is, perform prompt injection within the tool's description, which is then fed to the large language model (LLM), achieving an indirect injection, and then manipulating the LLM to exhibit malicious behavior when using other legitimate tools. For example, when calling a legitimate blockchain transfer tool, it redirects the address to another address. This is called 'Puppet Attack'. Then, for the Google Map server, it defined a malicious third-party URL within itself. It would request content from this URL and then directly provide the URL's response to the LLM. This essentially means the server acts as a springboard, responsible for forwarding the attacker's desired prompt injection to the LLM. We call this process 'Malicious Third-Party Resource Attack'. And finally, the WeChat server we just discussed, we refer to it as 'Rug Pull'. After hearing this, how would you rank the difficulty of exploiting these four types of attacks? And how would you rank their severity?

**Interviewee:** I think first and foremost, that prompt injection should be the most important, because by tampering with the transfer address, it would directly cause a relatively severe financial loss.

**Interviewer:** So, regarding the 'Puppet Attack' involving prompt injection that you just mentioned, would you say its exploitation difficulty is too high? Because it has many prerequisites, requiring multiple different MCP servers within the MCP system, and the user must have successfully configured others.

**Interviewee:** Its difficulty...

**Interviewer:** Exploitation difficulty, meaning the difficulty for the attacker.

**Interviewee:** Yes, I actually think the exploitation difficulty is quite high. On one hand, as you just mentioned, it needs to satisfy multiple calls like that; on the other hand, if the model itself (since it involves calling a large language model) has high security, it might also reject such behavior.

**Interviewer:** Then how would you rank the others? In terms of exploitation difficulty, so, essentially, the Puppet Attack is the highest, and then the others?

**Interviewee:** The others, besides WeChat, what else?

**Interviewer:** WeChat is the Rug Pull one.

**Interviewee:** Rug Pull, that's the npx one. I think this Rug Pull should be the easiest one to exploit, the simplest one.

**Interviewer:** Yes, good, okay. Okay, and for the severity, yes, you just said you think the Puppet Attack has the highest severity, and the others are pretty much on par, right?

**Interviewee:** Mm.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Now that this part is over, I'd like to ask for your thoughts on MCP ecosystem security. That is, would you consider, either in the past or future, using AI Agents combined with MCPs to manage your private data or resources, such as project source code, personal notes, and the blockchain wallet you just mentioned?

**Interviewee:** I would definitely use it, but for anything involving my very important private information, I wouldn't really consider using it.

**Interviewer:** Okay. Have you used MCP before?

**Interviewee:** I had some general understanding of it before, but I haven't used it locally on a client.

**Interviewer:** Okay. The next question is, for application marketplaces or aggregation websites for MCP servers, like the one simulated in the task that displays many MCP servers, what role do you think such websites should play in ensuring user security?

**Interviewee:** I think, whether they are MCP services provided by official vendors or individual developers, they should first undergo vulnerability scans and then issue detection information and reports. These reports should then be presented to users, letting them know that the service has undergone, in effect, official quality inspection, and can be downloaded with confidence.

**Interviewer:** Understood. You also think these portal websites should act as a first-hand filter for user security, right? A guarantee. Okay. What kind of information, or what kind of features or verification mechanisms, would make you particularly trust an MCP server when you, as a user, are looking for the corresponding MCP server?

**Interviewee:** For example, a report issued by a relatively authoritative security institution. This would be for source authentication.

**Interviewer:** So, for example, on the official website, it's marked that this server comes from an official source, something like that, is that what you mean by source authentication?

**Interviewee:** Yes, firstly, its release should be from an official source, and secondly, there should be a detection report issued by a reputable information security organization.

**Interviewer:** Okay. What kind of features or measures do you expect to see in the future to improve the security risks of MCP during its application?

**Interviewee:** Features... For MCP, for example, on one hand, as a software developer, I hope it can be more automated, efficient, and accurate, helping us to develop applications with one-click automation. And secondly, it should make our lives easier, for instance, by enabling end-to-end tasks like travel planning, which might involve various MCPs like Weather and WeChat. So, I still hope it can become more convenient and better.

**Interviewer:** So you feel that current MCPs are not very convenient to use?

**Interviewee:** Yes, the convenience isn't very strong. After all, it still requires some development experience; it doesn't feel like it's aimed at all users.

**Interviewer:** Okay, what about security? What kind of features and measures could improve MCP's security risks? Do you have any ideas?

**Interviewee:** Regarding security risks...

**Interviewer:** For example, security measures, like how there used to be 360 Total Security and such. Could there be detection tools within MCP as well? Or, if a user wants to run a server but is hesitant to run it directly locally, maybe there could be a security sandbox or security sandboxing. Do you have any preference for these kinds of things?

**Interviewee:** I think something like 360 would be good. It could integrate, for example, the official certification report we just mentioned, and besides that, it could also integrate some detection tools that users could choose to perform scans or runs.

**Interviewer:** Understood. So, source code auditing, and then tools for users or detection tools that allow users to easily detect and scan for vulnerabilities.

**Interviewee:** Mm, yes.

**Interviewer:** Then for the last question, do you have any suggestions or areas where you think the overall design of this user study could be improved?

**Interviewee:** I think the overall design is quite good. The only minor drawback is that perhaps providing some video tutorials might make it even simpler.

**Interviewer:** I understand, that's indeed a good suggestion. If only we had set up video tutorials earlier, I wouldn't have had to explain everything individually. Okay, thank you again for your time and effort in participating in this user interview. This interview concludes here.
