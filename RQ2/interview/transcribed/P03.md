**Interviewer:** Hello, I'm glad you could participate in our user survey about malicious MCP server users. Next, I will ask you a few questions. The first question is, when you were browsing and installing servers on our simulated website, did any servers arouse your suspicion? If so, what aspects of these servers made you suspicious?

**Interviewee:** Yes, there were. Regarding the two servers that provide time and weather services, when I reviewed their source code, I felt they might be malicious. Firstly, their structure was relatively simple; secondly, upon closer examination of their content, I found their descriptions resembled a large language model performing malicious acts. As for other aspects, such as description, name, and functionality, it would be difficult to spot issues without a careful review.

**Interviewer:** Alright. Then for the second question, while browsing these simulated MCP servers, how confident were you in identifying these malicious MCPs?

**Interviewee:** For cases where the malicious elements were relatively simple to hide, I was confident I could identify them, for example, if the malicious description was directly written in the source code. However, some were more difficult. For instance, if malicious code was hidden within very lengthy code, it would be quite challenging to identify. Also, if the server's description and name were very similar to those of legitimate official offerings, I wouldn't be able to distinguish them either.

**Interviewer:** Alright. And in the process of analyzing these malicious MCPs, which of these three types of information—introduction and description, source code, and configuration method—did you find most useful for judging malicious behavior? And which was least useful or most difficult to leverage?

**Interviewee:** For me personally, source code was the most useful aspect, as I habitually check the source code. Secondly, I believe the configuration method was the most difficult to leverage. It's truly hard to imagine such a behavior where its configuration method would be used to pull malicious code; that's really hard to conceive of.

**Interviewer:** Alright. My next question is, in the process of reviewing the source code as you just mentioned, were there any specific code patterns, function calls, or data processing methods that particularly raised your alert? If so, or which part did you find difficult to understand but also felt might pose a risk?

**Interviewee:** For example, if there were malicious descriptions within the tool's description itself, that would be relatively easy to spot and raise an alert immediately. However, other things, like an API maliciously requesting information—if that API itself were malicious—that would be much harder to discern. And some parts involved malicious obfuscation of the code. That is, the malicious code wouldn't be immediately apparent; you'd have to dissect it line by line to understand that it's performing a malicious act. That kind is quite difficult to comprehend.

**Interviewer:** Alright. Next, we previously explained to you the four types and methods of malicious MCP server attacks via text: Tool Poisoning Attack, Puppet Attack, Malicious Third-Party API Attack, and Rug Pull Attack. How would you rank the exploitation difficulty and severity of these four attack types?

**Interviewee:** My personal feeling is that, firstly, the simplest type is the MCP server that directly provides a malicious description. This should fall under Tool Poisoning Attack, correct? Yes, it provides—the tool itself is malicious. Correct. And then secondly, there's the Puppet Attack. Then thirdly, it should be the type involving malicious API requests. And I believe the one with the highest severity and exploitation difficulty—meaning highest severity and most difficult to detect—should be Rug Pull.

**Interviewer:** Alright, thank you. The next question is about your views on ecosystem security issues. That is, in the past or in the future, would you consider using an AI Agent combined with MCP to manage your private data or resources, such as project source code, blockchain wallets, etc.?

**Interviewee:** For services with high privacy requirements, such as blockchain wallets, I probably wouldn't use an AI Agent combined with MCP for management. However, for other aspects, such as publishing content, like source code or personal notes, I think this method would be a very good way to manage them.

**Interviewer:** Have you used MCP before?

**Interviewee:** No, I haven't specifically used it.

**Interviewer:** Alright. Then the next question is, for platforms like the MCP server portal website or marketplace we simulated in our task—what role do you think they should play in ensuring user safety? What key security indicators or information should they provide?

**Interviewee:** Firstly, I feel there needs to be strengthened vetting to definitely filter out servers that pretend to be official projects. The security indicators or information it should provide would include, for example, the official address of an official project, its homepage and homepage information, and its description should also be quite comprehensive. And ideally, there should be a clear indicator to measure it, like a score, to assess whether the server is safe. In this regard, I think these MCP server marketplaces or aggregation websites need to do better in terms of vetting.

**Interviewer:** Alright. The next question is, what kind of information, features, or claimed verification mechanisms on such a website do you think could significantly enhance your trust in an MCP server when you're choosing one?

**Interviewee:** As I mentioned before, providing a specific security rating or score, or user feedback and reviews, to see if any users point out that it's a malicious or unsafe MCP server. Also, source authentication, meaning a badge indicating official endorsement, could suggest that it's a relatively trustworthy server.

**Interviewer:** Alright. And in the future, if you were to use MCP servers, what features or measures would you expect to see to improve the security risks of MCP servers?

**Interviewee:** Implementing strengthened auditing, and using sandboxes for pre-execution to check for unknown or malicious behaviors, these kinds of features.

**Interviewer:** So, a credible third-party endorsement or audit report would enhance your security and increase your trust in the server, right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, exactly.

**Interviewer:** Understood, alright. For the final question, I'd like to ask if you have any suggestions or areas for improvement regarding the overall design of our user research, including the process and the questionnaire?

**Interviewee:** Perhaps at the very beginning of the tasks, some basic knowledge about MCP could be provided. This might be more user-friendly for those who haven't had much exposure to this area.

**Interviewer:** Alright, thank you for your answers. This interview concludes here.
